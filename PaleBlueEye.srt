Morning, gentlemen.

[horses whinnying]

-You Augustus Landor?
-I am.

8
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,250
And you?

9
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,375
Captain Hitchcock at your service.
Second-in-command at the Academy.

10
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,833
I'm here to inform you

11
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:14,791
Superintendent Thayer
requests an immediate audience.

12
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,916
-And the nature of this audience?
-I'll leave that to the colonel.

13
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,791
-When might this take place?
-At your earliest convenience.

[chuckles]

15
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:28,416
And if I should decide not to come?

16
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,291
That would be your own concern.
You're a private citizen.

[exhales deeply]

18
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,208
Well, it's a fine day for a ride.

You, uh…

36
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:54,666
You keep these notes in a pigeonhole
back there somewhere, do you?

37
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,666
What else do they say?

38
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,958
Do they say that I haven't
darkened the door of a church

39
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,625
in a long time?

40
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:07,000
Does it mention
that my daughter ran off a while back?

41
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,916
We are aware
of your daughter's disappearance.

42
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,416
And we offer our sympathy.

43
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,500
With all due respect,
I hope I have not offended.

44
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,166
No. No, no, no.

45
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,583
No, sorry. I ought to apologize.

46
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,375
And I do. Please carry on.

47
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,083
Mr. Landor, we are obliged
to proceed with extreme discretion.

48
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,708
We're looking for someone.

49
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,375
A private citizen
of well-documented industry and tact

50
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,958
who might carry out inquiries
on the Academy's behalf.

51
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,125
Huh.

52
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,625
They're of a highly complex
and delicate nature

53
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,333
and concern one of our cadets.

54
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,458
Second-year man
from Kentucky by the name of Fry.

55
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,916
-Leroy Fry.
-There's no point in dancing around it.

56
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,041
Fry hanged himself… last night.

57
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh.

58
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,541
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

59
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:12,458
A dreadful business, this.
But you must understand our position.

60
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:16,541
We have been specifically charged
with the care of these young men,

61
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:20,708
to make them gentlemen and soldiers,
and to that end, we drive them.

62
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:26,000
But we'd like to think
we know when to… stop driving them.

63
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,750
A boy hangs himself…

64
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:31,666
uh, that's a matter for the coroner.

65
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,750
[Hitchcock] I'm afraid
that's not the end of it.

66
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:41,500
Cadet Fry's body was
violated last night in the hospital ward.

67
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,541
Violated? By whom?

68
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,958
Well, if we knew that, we would
have had no need to summon you.

69
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,833
I'm sure the Academy
has its share of pranksters.

70
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,500
This was no prank, Mr. Landor.

71
00:05:56,375 --> 00:06:00,125
Leroy Fry's heart
was carved from his chest.

72
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,541
[somber music playing]

73
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:07,291
[Landor] Dr. Marquis, how does
a person go about doing this?

74
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:13,708
[Dr. Marquis] Scalpel. Or any good,
sharp knife would do.

75
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,458
But getting to the heart,
that's the tricky part.

76
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:24,416
Those gashes on the lungs and liver

77
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,625
came from angling
the blade to save the heart.

78
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,541
And how would one preserve the heart?

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,375
A container of some sort.

80
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,541
Wrapped in muslin, maybe, or newspaper.

81
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,666
Very likely surrounded by ice.

82
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,916
What type of fella could do this?

83
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,708
A strong one.

84
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,500
Not a woman, then?

85
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,083
No woman as I've ever had
the pleasure of meeting, no.

86
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,708
[Landor] What about his medical pedigree?

87
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,708
Would he need to be as well-educated
and well-trained as yourself?

88
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,416
Not necessarily.

89
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,083
He'd need a lot of light,
and know where to cut,

90
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:11,500
but it wouldn't have to be
a doctor or a surgeon.

91
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,166
-It'd have to be--
-A madman!

92
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,833
And still out there.

93
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,000
[drill sergeant] Port arms!

94
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,541
[Thayer] You'll have to forgive me,
Mr. Landor.

95
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,791
You've found us
in a very delicate position.

96
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,083
[drill sergeant] Left, face!

97
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,500
There are certain
powerful senators in Washington

98
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,375
who would like nothing more than
to see us fail utterly, to shut us down.

99
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:40,541
I'm asking you to help save the honor
of the United States Military Academy.

100
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,041
And save it, I'll try.

101
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,541
[pensive music playing]

102
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,333
[Landor] You were, uh, on guard duty
last night, Mr. Huntoon.

103
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,458
Yes, sir.

104
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,375
Post at 9:30. Relieved at midnight
and made my way back to the guardroom.

105
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,625
Where is that?

106
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,333
Number four, sir. By Fort Clinton.

107
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,125
I… I admit, I'm not very familiar
with the grounds,

108
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,916
but it seems that the part
we're standing on right now

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,583
is not on the way
from Fort Clinton to North Barracks.

110
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,708
-No, sir.
-Oh. What took you off course?

111
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,500
Well, sir, on my way, I heard something.

112
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,875
I reckoned it was an animal.

113
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,375
It sounded like it was dying
or caught in a trap, so I came to help.

114
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,541
I'm terribly partial to animals.

115
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:29,416
Uh… I was running this way
until I brushed Cadet Fry, sir.

116
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,833
-How'd he look?
-Not well, sir.

117
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,250
He wasn't hanging straight.

118
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,916
It was almost
as if he was seated in a chair.

119
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,666
I'm not following you.

120
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,458
Well, his feet were
touching the ground, sir.

121
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,875
-His feet were touching the ground?
-Yes, sir.

122
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,625
All right. What did you do next?

123
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,541
I ran. Ran straight back
to North Barracks.

124
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,416
Hmm.

125
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,875
Uh, one last question
and I'll trouble you no more.

126
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,333
Did you see anyone else about?

127
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,041
No, sir.

128
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,125
Mr. Huntoon.

129
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,833
[pensive music continues]

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
[Landor] <i>The neck…</i>

131
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,583
That's what first struck me.

132
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,208
See?

133
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,000
Not a clean cinch at all.
The rope grabbed at him

134
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:33,083
and ran up and down the neck
looking for purchase.

135
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,583
As though…

136
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,416
As though he was… fighting.

137
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:38,958
Hmm?

138
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,583
Look, if you would, at his fingers.

139
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,458
Blistered fresh
from clutching at the rope…

140
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,833
[door opens]

141
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,125
-…trying to peel the thing off him.
-[door closes]

142
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,416
May I ask what's going on here?

143
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,875
This is, uh, quite irregular.

144
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:01,500
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
feeling around the back of Mr. Fry's head.

145
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,833
You did examine Mr. Fry?

146
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,916
Of course I examined him, as is my job.

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,833
[Landor] Hmm.

148
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,125
[Dr. Marquis softly] Haven't we already
been through this?

149
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,375
-Uh…
-Hmm.

150
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,250
There is a contusion of sort.

151
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,625
Parietal region.

152
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,875
Approximately three inches.

153
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,375
[breathes deeply]

154
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,791
-I must have missed that.
-Mmm.

155
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,791
[Hitchcock] Someone murdered Mr. Fry.

156
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,000
Is this what
you're telling us, Mr. Landor?

157
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,166
You might be onto something there,
Captain Hitchcock.

158

could have missed that, doctor.

00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,666
Mr. Landor.

So now you're on board,

165
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,083
I think it's important
we set some ground rules.

166
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,750
You will report to me
on a daily basis and I to the colonel.

167
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,666
And you mustn't breathe a word of this
to anyone, inside or outside the Academy.

168
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,666
-Is that all?
-One final condition.

169
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,875
There will be no drinking throughout
the course of this investigation.

170

Oh.

175
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:35,875
Pardon.

176
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,416
-Are you Augustus Landor?
-[coughs] I am.

177
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Unless I mistake, you've been
tasked with solving the mystery

178
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,125
surrounding Leroy Fry.

179
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,416
That's so. What might I do for you?

180
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,250
It is incumbent upon me
and the honor of this institution

181
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,583
to divulge some of the conclusions
which I have reached.

182
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,625
Conclusions?

183
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,000
Regarding the late Mr. Fry.

184
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,625
I'd be most interested.

185
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,333
The man you're looking for

186
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,250
is a poet.

[marching band playing]

188

[Landor] Private Cochrane.

189
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,666
When Leroy Fry's body
was brought back to the hospital,

190
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,333
you were detailed to guard it?

191
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,625
I was, sir.

192
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,291
-Did anything happen while on watch?
-Not till around 2:30.

193
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,708
-That's when I was relieved of my duty.
-Who relieved you?

194
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,333
-Private, who relieved you?
-I can't tell you, sir.

195
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,916
Only that it was an officer.

196
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,541
-He never identified himself?
-No, sir.

197
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,291
But I wouldn't expect it of an officer.

198
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:49,583
Hmm.

199
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:51,333
What did this officer say to you?

200
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,541
He said, "Thank you, private.
That will be all. I'm relieving you."

201
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,291
-An odd request, no?
-Yes, sir. Very.

202
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,666
-Did you see this officer's face?
-No, sir.

203
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,875
I had only a candle. It was terribly dark.

204
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,750
Right, tell me then,
how did you know it was an officer?

205
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:15,416
The bar on his shoulder, sir.
But I must admit, it was so very strange.

206
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,375
-How so?
-The bars.

207
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,625
The bars on his left shoulder
were missing.

[Benny] Ah, there's the man himself.

213

Benny knows a man
who's in need of a drink when he sees one.

00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:49,125

What's grieving you?

220
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,958
Did you hear about that poor cadet?

221
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,583
-They say it took him hours to die.
-"They"?

Aren't you meant to be in recital?

224
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,750
Uh… Good evening. Recital?

225
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,291
No, I won't be missed.

226
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,791
They hardly know I'm at the Academy.

227
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:45,000
And besides, I've learned more
in rooms like this than any classroom.

228
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,250
I don't doubt it.

Um…

236
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:17,833
So tell me, how did you learn
about Leroy Fry?

237
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,333
Uh, well, from Huntoon, of course.

238
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:25,625
He has been spouting the news
like the town crier. [chuckles softly]

239
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,916
Perhaps someone
might hang <i>him</i> before too long.

240
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,916
You don't mean to imply
that someone <i>hanged</i> Mr. Fry?

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,916
I don't mean to imply anything.

242
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:43,458
Why do you think that the man
who cut Leroy Fry's heart out

243
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,166
was a poet?

244
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,791
Well…

245
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,750
The heart is a symbol or it is nothing.

246
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,583
Now take away the symbol
and what do you have?

247
00:16:56,291 --> 00:17:00,791
It's a fistful of muscle of no more
aesthetic interest than a bladder.

248
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,083
Now, to remove a man's heart
is to traffic in symbol.

249
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,250
And who better equipped for such labor

250
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,875
than a poet?

251
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,750
Awfully literal-minded poet,
it would seem--

252
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,333
Oh, you cannot pretend
that this act of savagery

253
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:21,958
did not startle the literary resonances
from the very crevices of your mind.

254
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,041
Lord Suckling's charming song,

255
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:31,125
<i>"I prithee send me back my heart</i>
<i>Since I cannot have thine"</i>

256
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,333
Or… Or the Bible even,

257
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,291
"Create in me a clean heart, O God."

258
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,416
"A broken and a contrite heart
thou wilt not despise."

259
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:44,500
Then we might just as easily
be seeking a religious maniac.

260
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:49,208
No, you see, I neglected
to tell you that I am a poet myself,

261
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,916
hence inclined to think as one.

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,333
[exhales heavily]
I don't get around to poetry much.

263
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,875
Why should you? You're an American.

264
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,541
And you?

265
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,708
An artist.
That is to say, without country.

266
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,333
-Oh… [laughing]
-What, Mr. Landor?

267
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,708
You've been a great help.

268
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,916
You want a second look
at a cadet named Loughborough.

269
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:22,833
In former days, Leroy Fry's roommate,
until they had a falling out.

270
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,375
The nature of which remains uncertain.

271
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
[unsettling music playing]

272
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,708
[Hitchcock] Mr. Loughborough.

273
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:53,208
Tell Mr. Landor
how you were acquainted with Mr. Fry.

274
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes, sir. We were roommates.

275
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:56,916
Hmm.

276
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,750
You ever have a falling out?

277
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,833
I wouldn't call it a falling out. Just…

278
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,625
a matter of diverging paths, sir.

279
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,958
-What made you diverge?
-Well…

280
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,208
Nothing so…

281
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,416
A matter of course.

282
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,916
[sternly] If you know of anything
pertaining to Mr. Fry,

283
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,833
you're bound to disclose it at once.

284
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,666
Well, it's like this, sir.

285
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,958
I'd say he'd fallen in with

286
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,833
a bad bunch.

287
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,166
At least that's what he called them.

288
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,083
[Landor] Now then, tell me,
by "bad bunch,"

289
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,041
did he mean other cadets?

290
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,333
[Loughborough] He never said,
but I assumed so.

291
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,750
And why didn't you come forward earlier?

292
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,041
I didn't quite see
that it had any bearing,

293
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,291
happening so long ago, sir.

294
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Dismissed.

295
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:03,750
Mr. Stoddard.

296
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,625
You were the last one
to see Mr. Fry alive.

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,166
Yes, sir.

298
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,583
-Speak up.
-I'm just a bit ill, sir.

299
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:18,125
[clears throat] I did see Leroy
late on the night in question.

300
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,500
Passed him on the way
to barracks as I was coming in.

301
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,208
You spoke to him?

302
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,625
He stopped me,
asking if any officers were about.

303
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,791
How did Mr. Fry look?

304
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,875
It was so very dark.
I… I wouldn't trust my memory.

305
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:39,083
Did you see anything
on his person, a length of rope, maybe?

306
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,666
-None that I could see.
-Hmm.

307
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,541
There was something. Uh…

308
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,875
As Fry was leaving, I did ask
where he was off to at such an hour.

309
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
And?

310
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,500
He said, "Necessary business."

311
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,458
What did you take that to mean?

312
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,166
I don't know.

313
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,625
-[Landor clears throat]
-Dismissed.

314
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,750
-[cadet] Pardon me, captain.
-Yes.

315
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,875

murdered and mutilated in Cold Spring."

317
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,000
"Their chests most cruelly carved open
and their hearts removed."

318
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,583
Are any of God's creatures
immune from this man?

319
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,208
We don't know that this is the same man.

320
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,125
What?

321
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,416
Coincidence, is it?

322
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,000
Effective 0600 tomorrow morning,

323
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:03,291
all men will only attend
class, meals, prayer services.

324
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:04,958
Nothing more!

325
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,583
[Landor] If any of your classmates ask,

326
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,583
we did nothing more than discuss
your acquaintance with Leroy Fry.

327
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,166
[Poe] There was no acquaintance.
I never knew him.

328
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,041
-[Landor] What?
-I never knew the fellow.

329
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,708
-[Landor] Then I misunderstood you.
-Huh. You're not the first.

330
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,708
So, if this is not a discussion,
what is it?

331
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,125
An offer of employment.

332
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,250
There's no pay.

333
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,458
None of your classmates
may know what you're doing

334
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,750
until long after you're done with it.

335
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,583
If they do find out,
they'll likely curse your name.

336
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,458
Oh! An irresistible offer.
[chuckles dryly]

337
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,875
No, um, please, tell me more.

338
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,500
Excellent. I need you to decipher this…
This segment of a larger note.

339
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:04,000
You'll have to work secretly
and as precisely as you can.

340
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,666
[melancholy music playing]

341
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,125
[melancholy music continues]

342
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,458
[knocking at door]

343
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,791
I am pleased to report
I have successfully decoded your message.

344
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:11,166
Hmm. Handwritten,
it is of a personal nature.

345
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,583
Fry had it with him
at the time of his death.

346
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,833
From that,
we may presume it was sufficient

347
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:19,083
to draw him from his barracks
on the night in question.

348
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,208
As the rest of the message
was torn from his hand,

349
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:25,875
we may presume that the note,
in some way, identified its sender.

350
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,833
Now the use
of rather primitive black capitals

351
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:32,750
would also indicate that the sender
wished to disguise his identity.

352
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:38,666
An invitation of sorts, or might we
more accurately call it a trap. [claps]

353
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,416
A trap?

354
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:42,458
Hmm.

355
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,916
-Now, with that in mind… Oh, may I?
-Mmm-hmm.

356
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,708
Let's concentrate
our labors on the third line

357
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,833
which we know, for a fact, is complete.

358
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,416
"Be." But be what?

359
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,541
Something that begins with "L."

360
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,458
"Little"? "Lucky"?

361
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:04,125
No. Neither gibes with the invitation.

362
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:09,000
"Be lost"?
No. No. Too ungainly a construction.

363
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:13,125
If in fact Leroy Fry's attendance was
desired at a particular time and place,

364
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,958
there is but one word, "late."

365
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,958
"Be late."

366
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,208
And as we scan the third line,

367
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:26,041
the first word becomes almost
insultingly simple to deduce, "don't."

368
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,625
So, "Don't be late."

369
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,791
Now, look closely, Mr. Landor.

370
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,333
We need not journey far
for a suitable candidate.

371
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:40,333
If Fry is going
to a predetermined location,

372
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:43,916
he was, from the perspective
of the writer, coming.

373
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,041
So, "Come, Mr. Fry."

374
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:50,125
Now, with that in place,
it is the height of simplicity

375
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,625
to deduce the next word.
Can it be any other than "soon"?

376
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:56,125
We insert the word, <i>et voilà!</i>

377
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,541
"Don't be late. Come soon."

378
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:02,083
And there you have it,
the solution to our <i>petite énigme</i>

379
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:05,083
-respectfully submitted.
-Mmm-hmm.

380
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,625
First-rate work. I thank you.

381
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,333
-Just one thing.
-Yes?

382
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,750
Did you have any luck
with the first two lines?

383
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,416
Well, I was forced to declare them a loss.

384
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,583
Are you a good speller?

385
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh, flawless. Judged so
by no less an authority

386
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,250
than the Reverend John Bransby
of Stoke Newington.

387
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:35,875
So I take it that you've never done
what so many of… us do.

388
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:39,791
Misspell similar sounding words.

389
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:46,916
For example,
"they're," "their," and "there."

390
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,000
A common solecism.

391
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,625
An invitation indeed. "Meet me there."

392
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:57,125
Of course, we still don't know
where to meet, do we?

393
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:02,041
Something with "N-G" trailing behind.

394
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:04,958
The landing!

395
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,750
-And might I add, the cove by the landing.
-Excellent choice.

396
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:14,958
So, "I'll be at the cove by the landing."

397
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,125
"Meet me there at say, 11:00 p.m. or so."

398
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:21,541
So, "Don't be late. Come see me."
Might be closer to the mark.

399
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,041
-[Poe] Yeah.
-Ah…

400
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,166
Does this suggest anything to you?

401
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:28,083
Why would he meet
a fellow cadet at the landing

402
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,541
-when you can meet him anywhere?
-Hmm.

403
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:37,500
Because it's not a cadet, but a woman.

404
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:38,416
[Landor] Hmm.

405
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:43,500
You knew the solution
all along, Mr. Landor.

406
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:44,708
I had an idea.

407
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:49,125
Well, if this is indeed a woman we seek,

408
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:54,083
I believe I may be credited
with a sighting of her.

409
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:00,625
The morning after Leroy Fry's death,
before I knew anything of what had passed,

410
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:07,250
I awoke, and began speaking
the opening lines of a poem,

411
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:14,041
<i>lines that speak of a mysterious woman</i>
<i>in profound distress.</i>

412
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:20,625
<i>Then, just outside the mess,</i>
<i>appears the most beautiful creature</i>

413
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,041
<i>I've ever had the pleasure</i>
<i>of laying eyes on.</i>

414
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,750
[Landor] <i>Who was she?</i>

415
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,958
I haven't the faintest.

416
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:37,791
But why do you believe that this poem
or young woman are connected with Mr. Fry?

417
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,916
The air of concealed violence.

418
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,625
Unspeakable duress.

419
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,750
An unknown woman.

420
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,291
You could have woken
any morning and written this.

421
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:55,166
But I didn't write it. It was dictated.

422
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:57,458
-Dictated?
-Mmm-hmm.

423
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,125
By whom?

424
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:03,500
My mother.

425
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,041
She's dead.

426
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,083
Dead nearly, uh, 20 years.

427
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,750
[Landor] <i>Tell me about this Poe fella.</i>

428
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,000
Oh, Poe, he…

429
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,541
A lovely boy.

430
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:35,583
Beautiful manners. Um… Talks a lot.

431
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:40,583
Definitely. And definitely
something peculiar about him.

432
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,791
[chuckling] Because he talks a lot?

433
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,291
No, because he's filled
with senseless fantasies.

434
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,000
Tells me about a poem,

435
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,916
claims it has something
to do with Leroy Fry's death.

436
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,958
Claims it was dictated to him
in his sleep by his dead mother.

437
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:10,375
You of all people know
that the people we lost…

438
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,125
are always with us.

439
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:23,625
Man will do most anything
to cheat death, won't he?

Where Fry's heart was brought.

465
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:16,500
You mentioned the taking
of Fry's heart drew you to the Bible.

466
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,208
I must admit.
I was already moving in that direction.

467
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,916
Not to the Bible.

468
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,333
But to religion.

469
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:30,291

a ceremony of some sort.

And Fry's heart very likely placed inside.

473
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:56,708
I have an old friend
who might be of some use.

474
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:01,166
[pensive music playing]

475
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:09,000
[Landor] <i>Professor Jean Pépé</i>
<i>is an expert in symbols…</i>

476
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,791
-[Landor] Pépé!
<i>-…rituals…</i>

477
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,000
[knocking at door]

478
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,083
<i>-…the occult.</i>
-Professor!

479
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,083
[Landor] <i>Pépé might be</i>

480
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,541
<i>-the most peculiar man…</i>
-[Pépé] Come in. I'm back here.

481
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:20,583
-[Landor] Sorry to intrude.
<i>-…I've had the pleasure of coming across.</i>

482
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:24,625
[Landor] I, uh, bring something curious
I would like you to observe.

483
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,041
[Pépé] Uh…

484
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:30,041
This can only be a magic circle.

485
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:34,208
I remember seeing it in
<i>Le Véritable Dragon Rouge.</i>

486
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:37,708
And if I recall all right,
the magician would stand there

487
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,333
in the triangle.

488
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,083
Alone?

489
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,833
Well, he might have
a group of assistants.

490
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,875
And candles and torches
on either side, light everywhere,

491
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,916
a festival of light, in fact.

492
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:55,416
Now, Gus, if you go to the third shelf…

493
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,125
On the second to the top.

494
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,125
That volume on the top.

495
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,375
Yes. Yes.

496
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,583
Pierre de Lancre,
redoubtable witch hunter.

497
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:17,375
-You read French, Mr. Poe?
-Well, yes.

498
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,208
Please read in silence.
It's in the center page.

499
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,875
De Lancre executed 600 Basque witches

500
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,666
and left behind
the remarkable volume you now peruse.

501
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,291
But the book I wish to give you,
<i>Discours du Diable</i> by Henri Le Clerc,

502
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:38,125
who executed 700 witches
before he was done,

503
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,958
is reputed to have been destroyed.

504
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:44,541
Now, rumor has it that he left behind
two or three other volumes

505
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,875
identical to the one destroyed.

506
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:53,000
Now, finding one has become
the <i>idée fixe</i> of many an occult collector.

507
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:57,333
-Why?
-Why? Ooh… [chuckles]

508
00:37:57,416 --> 00:38:01,958
Le Clerc left behind instructions
for securing…

509
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,250
immortality.

510
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,875
[Poe] Oh, my Lord.

511
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,125
"It is commonly known
among the fraternity of evil angels

512
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,833
that the contents
of a witch's sabbath feast

513
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:20,041
are confined to the following sundries."

514
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:24,458
"Unclean animals such as are
never eaten by Christian peoples,

515
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,291
the hearts of unbaptized children,

516
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:33,333
and the hearts of hanged men."

517
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,375
[drum roll]

518
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,958
[Landor] <i>I need you</i>
<i>to discretely infiltrate the cadets,</i>

519
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,500
<i>see if you can ferret out which of them</i>
<i>may have a connection to the occult.</i>

520
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:55,708
[Lee] <i>Explain yourself.</i>

521
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,125
Well, um, certain overtures
have been made to me,

522
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,958
rather dark, and shall I say,
unchristian overtures.

523
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,000
-Unchristian?
-Yes.

524
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:06,000
I've been spurred to question
the very grounds of my faith.

525
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:09,833
And to dabble in mysterious and arcane
practices of an ancient provenance.

526
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:12,791
-Arcane practices?
-He means black magic. Who was it?

527
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,375
[clears throat] I demand to know.

528
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,208
[Poe] I'm honor bound
not to reveal his name.

529
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:17,125
[Lee] Who was it?

530
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,416
You can't drag it from me,

531
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,666
not if God himself threatened
to smite me with a lightning bolt.

532
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,333
-If you want to join our prayers--
-No, I gave my word.

533
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,166
-One asks you to question your faith--
-It must stay private.

534
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,333
Was it Marquis?

535
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,458
Hamilton, watch yourself.

536
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:34,791
[Poe]<i> Yes, I have a name,</i>
<i>but I need a face to go with it.</i>

537
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,083
-[Dr. Marquis] Vertigo, hmm?
-Mmm.

538
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,666
Well, things are swirling about.

539
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,625
Your heart rate is rather quick.

540
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:58,375
Very well, Mr. Poe,
keep to the house today

541
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,125
and take care of yourself.

542
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:05,791
Present this to Lieutenant Locke
and his cadet commandeer,

543
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,041
Artemus, my son.

544
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:12,333
He'll make sure
you're relieved of your duties.

545
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,250
[Locke] You wish to be excused
from class because you were feeling

546
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,333
vertiginous?

547
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,375
And an even worse ailment not noted.

548
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,458
A grand ennui seizure.

549
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:27,958
"Grand ennui"?

550
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:30,416
Of a most pronounced character.

551
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,000
Mind yourself, Poe.

552
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,875
You may ask the doctor yourself.

553
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,500
It's true, Lieutenant.

554
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:41,791
My father did tell me
he's never seen anything quite like it.

555
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:42,875
Very well.

556
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:47,166
But I am charging you
with unbecoming brazenness.

557
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,666
Three demerits.

558
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,666
Return at once to your quarters.

559
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,833
And you would best be there when
the officers come around for inspection.

560
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,458
[drill sergeant shouting commands]

561
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,916
-Poe, is it?
-Yes.

562
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,375
Artemus Marquis.

563
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:16,000
I must say, your brazenness is admirable.

564
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,083
Tonight, eleven o'clock.
18 North Barracks.

565
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:28,916
[Poe] Apologies for my tardiness.
I hope I haven't kept you too long.

566
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,708
This is lovely.

567
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,208
[gasps] Books!

568
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,458
You have never interested me more.

569
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:45,625
Where to begin? Oh…

570
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:51,958
The lamentable Fenimore Cooper.
I guess every library must have one.

571
00:41:52,833 --> 00:41:54,416
Ooh, what a collection.

572
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:58,041
History of Egypt, and all sorts.

573
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,416
You've been found out.

574
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,333
Oh?

575
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:11,000
You gave me to understand
you didn't read poetry.

576
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,791
I don't.

577
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:15,916
Byron!

578
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:19,916
-A personal favorite, Mr. Landor…
-Please.

579
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
…and might I say, terribly well-thumbed.

580
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,708
That's my daughter's.

581
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:32,541
[clears throat]

582
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:37,375
And your daughter is no longer here?

583
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:40,958
No. No, she ran off with someone.

584
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:43,541
Someone you knew?

585
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:45,875
In passing.

586
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,291
And she's never to return?

587
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:51,791
Not likely.

588
00:42:53,208 --> 00:42:55,416
Then we're both alone in this world.

589
00:42:57,125 --> 00:42:58,541
But you have your mother.

590
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,833
She still speaks to you.

591
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,208
-At any rate.
-[chuckling] Yes.

592
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,541
Yes, from time to time.

593
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:12,541
And I might add, whatever's good in me,
in person, in spirit, comes from her.

594
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:19,250
Your daughter. What's her name?
If you don't object.

595
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:22,583
Mathilde.

596
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:26,875
Mattie.

597
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,333
You needn't say anymore, Mr. Landor.

598
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:40,583
-So you say you found something.
-Well, no. Better than that.

599
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:43,916
Someone goes by the name Marquis.

600
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,416
The doctor.

601
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,000
No. His son, Artemus.

602
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:53,000
And I have tasked myself with maneuvering
into his impenetrable peer group.

603
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:54,458
[door opens]

604
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:57,541
[Stoddard] Here's another
good creature of God.

605
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,250
Courtesy of <i>la</i> divine Patsy.

606
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:05,750
[Ballinger] Are you going to report us
for defying curfew, Poe?

607
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:11,375
Do our wee transgressions offend thee?

608
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:17,833
Not only am I not offended,
Mr. Ballinger, but, mmm…

609
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:21,625
another round is in order.

610
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,791
[Artemus chuckles]

611
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:28,583
[Ballinger] Drink it.

612
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:31,833
All of it, woman.

613
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:34,541
[Stoddard] Ballinger, you really
are quite the bully tonight.

614
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:35,458
[Poe] Mmm.

615
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:39,083
Another, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

616
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,375
Oh, I thank you.

617
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,000
Mmm.

618
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,458
-I can do this all night.
-[Artemus] Uh-uh.

619
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:51,708
Easy, Ballinger.

620
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,041
I've gone to great trouble
to secure that mash.

621
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:56,958
Poe.

622
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,000
I understand you're a published poet.

623
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,541
I am told I evidence a humble gift.

624
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:06,791
[chuckles] Well, then I demand
a public reading.

625
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:09,750
-Pleasure us.
-Oh. [chuckles]

626
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:16,791
<i>I met a lewd nude in Bermuda</i>

627
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:19,208
<i>Who thought she was shrewd</i>

628
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,250
<i>I was shrewder</i>

629
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,791
<i>She thought it quite crude</i>
<i>To be wooed in the nude</i>

630
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:28,416
<i>I pursued her</i>
<i>Subdued her and screwed her</i>

631
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:31,125
-[laughing]
-Well done, Poe.

632
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:32,875
Bravo.

633
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:39,083
Losing card… is a seven.

634
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,333
Winning card… is a jack.

635
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:44,333
Oh!

636
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:46,541
[Artemus] Well, well, well.
It's your lucky day, Poe.

637
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:48,083
Thank you.

638
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Is it true, Poe, that Detective Landor
interrogated you about Fry?

639
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:59,208
He was mistakenly under the impression
that I was an intimate of Fry's.

640
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Were you?

641
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,125
I was not.

642
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:08,041
Fitting that the only thing
that Fry could do to gain attention

643
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,541
was to hang himself.

644
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:15,708
[Stoddard] I think he hanged himself
in despair over being jilted by a lady.

645
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:17,791
[Lee] And what lady
might that be, Stoddard?

646
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,708
[Ballinger] What of your sister, Artemus?

647
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:23,000
Didn't she dazzle Fry?

648
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,333
[Artemus] Oh, come now, Randy.

649
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,500
You were closer to Fry
than anyone in this room.

650
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:33,750
I don't believe
I was so near to him… [inhales]

651
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,750
…as you.

652
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:44,791
[chuckles]

653
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:52,166
All right. Where were we?

654
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:54,416
[bell tolling in distance]

655
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,291
Halt!

656
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:26,250
Curfew not apply to you, Mr. Poe?

657
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,541
Explain yourself.

658
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:32,000
Candles were
to be extinguished three hours ago.

659
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,750
[clears throat] I'm sorry, sir.

660
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,958
Your apologies have always
rung hollow with me.

661
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:42,375
Leroy Fry met his maker
when he too was out after curfew.

662
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:46,750
Return to barracks at once.

663
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:50,916
You're lucky you're not
digging your own grave.

664
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,458
Thank you, sir.

665
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,666
Pick up the pace.

666
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,041
[soft scraping]

667
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,250
[Mathilde muttering indistinctly]

668
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:22,333
[muttering continues]

669
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:33,625
[sniffles]

670
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:35,458
[whispers] Mattie?

671
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:46,041
[exhales shakily]

672
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:54,833
[wardrobe opens]

673
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:57,666
[sighs softly]

674
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:01,500
[melancholy music playing]

675
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:02,958
[sobbing]

676
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,666
[sniffling]

677
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:21,166
[melancholy music continues]

678
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,666
[imperceptible]

679
00:49:40,708 --> 00:49:41,541
[sniffles]

680

[priest] "Remember thou me
for thy goodness' sake, O Lord."

682
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:59,333
"For in death
there is no remembrance of thee,

683
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:03,500
in thy grave who shall give thee thanks?"

684
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:06,375
"According to thy mercy,

685
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:11,041
remember thou me
for thy goodness' sake, O Lord."

686
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,250
"Mine eye is consumed because of grief."

687
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:21,708
You're Mr. Landor. Aren't you?

688
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:23,208
I am.

689
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:26,125
[sniffles] I'm Leroy's mother.

690
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,666
I'd like you to have this. [sniffles]

691
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,166
Leroy's diary.

692
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:36,875
It goes back at least three years.

693
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,166
I don't recall…

694
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:41,375
I'm sorry.

695
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,166
Terrible loss.

696
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:50,916
I don't recall any diary
being found with his personal effects.

697
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,875
It was Mr. Ballinger who sent it to me.

698
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,250
-Mr. Ballinger?
-Yes.

699
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:58,000
As soon as he heard what had happened,

700
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:01,625
he went straight to Leroy's quarters
to see what could be done.

701
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,458
The dear boy mailed it to me. [sobs]

702
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:04,375
I see.

703
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:08,750
And just now… as soon as he saw me,

704
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:14,583
he said, "I thought you should have
Leroy's diary with you in Kentucky."

705
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:17,958
"And if you feel like burning it,
go right ahead."

706
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,583
How considerate of him.

707
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,291
But I can make no sense of it.

708
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,750
All the numbers and letters…

709
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:30,875
But… seeing how the Army
is depending on you,

710
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,625
it seems only right
that you should have it.

711
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:46,166
[pensive music playing]

712
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:08,875
[Julia] I'll be back to meet you
all the time.

713
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:10,875
-To manage her needs…
-[Dr. Marquis] I understand.

714
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:12,875
…'cause all of us are in this together.

715
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,083
[Landor] Doctor!

716
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:19,541
[Dr. Marquis] Ah, Mr. Landor.
What a pleasant surprise.

717
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:23,875
Uh, please, let me introduce you
to my wife, Julia.

718
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,625
I've heard so much about you.

719
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:29,125
It's a pleasure.

720
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:32,958
Aren't you the gentleman
inquiring after Mr. Fry's death?

721
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:34,666
I am.

722
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,833
Well, we were just discussing the matter.

723
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:43,666
Indeed, my husband informs me
that despite his own heroic efforts,

724
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:49,625
the body of Mr. Fry had been judged
too far along for public display.

725
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,375
Hmm.

726
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,208
His poor parents.

727
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:55,708
Oh. Indeed.

728
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,916
Well, this whole matter has shaken us.

729
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:03,916
Be assured, I won't rest
until we've apprehended him.

730
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,708
Lovely to make your acquaintance.

731
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:12,500
My dear.

732
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:15,833
I understand you're a widower, Mr. Landor.

733
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:18,916
That is so.

734
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,708
Well, all due sympathy.

735
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:25,833
Was it recent?
Your wife going to her reward?

736
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,541
Two years ago now.

737
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:33,041
Only a few months
after we moved to the Highlands.

738
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,916
A sudden illness, was it?

739
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:39,291
Not sudden…

740
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:41,666
enough.

741
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,375
Well, your sacrifices aren't lost on me.

742
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:50,000
-Condolences.
-Thank you.

743
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,083
[Julia] Hmm.

744
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:02,458
-[piano playing]
-[wind whistling]

745
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,333
Brava.

746
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,166
Edgar, did I not tell you
my sister is a prodigy?

747
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,500
Marvelous, my dear.
Brought a tear to my eye.

748
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:36,458
[Poe] Yeah.

749
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:39,125
A lovely run, Miss Marquis.

750
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:40,666
-Truly.
-Yes.

751
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,375
Your immortality is assured.

752
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,958
I can't think of any woman
who wishes to be immortal, Randy.

753
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:50,375
I am at once reminded
of Sir Thomas Grey's,

754
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,750
<i>"Full many a flower</i>
<i>Is born to blush unseen"</i>

755
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:56,583
<i>"And waste its sweetness</i>
<i>On the desert air"</i>

756
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,041
A favorite, Mr. Poe.

757
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:05,250
And what do you think
of my little protégé?

758
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:08,791
I think Mr. Poe is far beyond
being anyone's protégé.

759
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:12,000
He's certainly not to be corrupted
by the likes of you.

760
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,750
[cadets chuckle]

761
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:15,833
[Julia] All right, Lea.

762
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:19,333
That's enough now.
You need to rest before dinner.

763
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,875
-[coughs] If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
-[Ballinger] Thank you, Lea.

764
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:25,875
[Artemus] Randy, chairs.

765
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:28,208
Stoddard, come on, man. Chess board.

766
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,208
All right. I'm bored now.

767
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,541
[Julia] I don't care! She's ill.

768
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,125
In her condition,
she shouldn't be entertaining at all.

769
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,708
[Poe] Miss Marquis.

770
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,750
Oh, um… Pardon me.

771
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:49,916
Nothing would afford me greater pleasure
than an audience with you on Saturday.

772
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:56,291
I'm sure that's true, Mr. Poe,
but… I'm afraid I'm engaged Saturday.

773
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,208
Ah, I see.

774
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,375
[in French]
Your coat and your hat, sir.

775
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,250
Thank you, Eugenia. You needn't have.

776
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,833
I could have fetched my coat myself.

777
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:08,833
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

778
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:13,000
You speak French, Mr. Poe.

779
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,666
With an accent that is rather charming.

780
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,083
[in English] So you propose this Saturday?

781
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,041
Or Sunday, if that's preferable.

782
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:30,916
Or Monday, even.

783
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,250
And where do you propose this audience?

784
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:35,916
Let me guess.
Gee's Point? Flirtation Walk?

785
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Oh, no, no, no.

786
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:38,875
Neither, I'm afraid, no.

787
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:41,458
I had in mind the cemetery.

788
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,833
-The cemetery?

disemboweling my men.

949
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:18,416
Men who barely carry out their duties,
hardly leave their barracks or sleep.

950
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,250
And if they can sleep,
do so with their muskets!

951
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:22,666
[scoffs]

952
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,666
I'm beginning to believe
you no longer think I'm competent

953
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,916
to undertake this investigation.

954
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:34,166
Thank you, doctor.

955
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:45,208
It's not your competence we question,
it's your allegiance.

956
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:50,166
Is there any possibility that this
could have been the work of Mr. Poe?

957
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:52,041
Poe?

958
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:54,791
Just yesterday,
he was regaling his table mates

959
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:58,500
with an heroic account
of his epic tussle with Mr. Ballinger,

960
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:02,083
declaring that he
fully intended to kill him

961
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:04,500
should they ever cross swords again.

962
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,208
You've seen Poe.

963
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:11,291
Can you honestly tell me
he subdued Ballinger?

964
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:15,083
No, there would have been no need.
Firearm would have turned the trick.

965
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:17,583
Whatever his relations with Ballinger,

966
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:21,958
there's no sign of any link
between Poe and Leroy Fry.

967
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:25,125
-They didn't even know each other.
-[Thayer] Oh, but they did.

968
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,791
They had a tussle
of their own last summer.

969
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:33,958
I don't suppose he ever volunteered
that bit of information, did he?

970
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:36,041
[pensive music building]

971
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,125
Then arrest him.

972
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:43,958
Arrest him if you are so persuaded.

973
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:45,958
All we have is motive.

974
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:49,166
We're looking to you to supply evidence!

975
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:54,958
Mr. Landor, do you harbor
a latent hostility toward this Academy?

976
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:56,541
Is that it?

977
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:05,208
I am risking my life
on behalf of your precious institution.

978
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:09,250
But yes.

979
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:16,875
I do believe that the Academy
takes away a young man's will.

980
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:21,125
It fences him with regulations and rules.

981
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:27,291
Deprives him of reason.
It makes him less human.

982
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:32,125
Are you implying
the Academy is to blame for these deaths?

983
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:36,500
Someone connected to the Academy, yes.
Hence, the Academy itself.

984
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,000
[Hitchcock] Well, that's absurd.

985
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,291
By your standard,

986
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:44,000
every crime committed
by a Christian will be a stain on Christ.

987
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,541
And so it is.

988
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:49,791
[pensive music continues]

989
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
[music fades]

990
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:07,583
When I first asked you… to take this job,

991
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:16,166
you told me you never
had dealings with Leroy Fry, so, uh…

992
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,333
Let's start there. Well?

993
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:26,541
-Well, that's not entirely true--
-Well… Well… Well…

994
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:29,166
Why is nothing simple with you, Poe?

995
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,666
Where are the facts?
Where are the simple facts?

996
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,083
Yes! Or no!

997
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,625
The truth!

998
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:43,083
-Did you know Leroy Fry?
-Yes.

999
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:47,333
Did you have words with Leroy Fry?

1000
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,208
Yes. Yes.

1001
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,291
Did you kill Leroy Fry?

1002
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,916
Did you kill Randolph Ballinger?

1003
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,833
[softly] No.

1004
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:07,333
[exhales]

1005
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:15,375
Did you have anything to do
with the desecrating of their bodies?

1006
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:18,916
-No, no, no. May I be struck dead if I--
-But you do not deny

1007
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,791
that you threatened both men?

1008
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:25,125
Well, as it relates
to Ballinger, that was…

1009
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,833
I never meant it.

1010
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:35,750
-And Fry?
-I never once threatened him. I merely--

1011
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:41,000
There is
a very disturbing pattern here, Poe.

1012
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:46,791
Men who cross you
end up on the wrong end of a noose

1013
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:51,958
with rather important organs
carved from their chests.

1014
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:54,041
Mr. Landor…

1015
01:13:57,791 --> 01:13:59,958
[sighs deeply]
If I were to kill every cadet

1016
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:02,958
who had abused me
during my brief tenure here,

1017
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:08,041
I'm afraid you would find
the Corp of Cadets

1018
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,791
reduced to less than a dozen.

1019
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:17,250
Now, if you must know,
I've been a figure of fun

1020
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,833
from my very first day here.

1021
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:26,375
My manner, my age, my person…

1022
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,291
my aesthetics.

1023
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:36,666
If I had a thousand lifetimes,

1024
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:39,166
I could not begin
to address all the injuries

1025
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,583
that have been done to me.

1026
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:48,250
Yes, I am guilty of a great,
great many things, but never that.

1027
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:52,208
Never murder.

1028
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,875
Now do you believe me?

1029
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:06,166
I believe that you should take better care
of what you say and do.

1030
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:14,416
For now, I can probably
hold off Hitchcock.

1031
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:21,833
But if you ever lie to me again,

1032
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:27,250
they can clap you in irons
and I won't lift a finger to help you.

1033
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:30,458
Do you understand me?

1034
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,333
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm expected for dinner.

1035
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:51,583
[exhales]

1036
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:15,916
Thank you for joining us
in mourning Randolph's untimely passing.

1037
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:19,541
The dear boy was family.

1038
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:28,875
Don't you find my son
exceptionally handsome, Mr. Landor?

1039
01:16:32,458 --> 01:16:33,333
Um…

1040
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:41,083
I would judge both of your children
to have been blessed in that regard.

1041
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:44,583
[Julia] Yes, we are hereditarily blessed.

1042
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:50,000
But I must say, I do find you a rarity.

1043
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:54,458
A person of exceptional intelligence.

1044
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,291
The quality in such
ridiculously short supply here.

1045
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,666
[Artemus] And with that intelligence,
Mr. Landor,

1046
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,166
I hope when you're finished
with your official business,

1047
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:10,541
you will assist me
with a puzzle of my own.

1048
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:13,916
-Oh, a puzzle?
-The strangest affair.

1049
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,958
While in recital, Monday,

1050
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:20,416
it appears someone
had rifled through my belongings.

1051
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:23,250
-[Landor] Oh.
-[Dr. Marquis] Well, eh…

1052
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:27,125
-Terrible people are abroad.
-Really, Father?

1053
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,416
I was inclining toward the theory
that the fellow was simply rude,

1054
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,166
while, of course,
having no idea who he was.

1055
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:39,041
All the same,
you must be careful, Artemus.

1056
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:41,625
-You really must.
-Oh, Mother.

1057
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,625
It was probably
just some tiresome old fellow

1058
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:50,208
with nothing better to do
and no life of his own to speak of.

1059
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:53,958
A rustic sort of cottager.

1060
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,416
Don't you think, Mr. Landor?

1061
01:17:58,625 --> 01:18:00,041
Oh.

1062
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:02,125
-You have a cottage, don't you?
-Artemus.

1063
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:06,208
You may even have some
very near relations who fit the pattern.

1064
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:09,541
Perhaps a dear friend who likes
a tipple and to drink in a tavern.

1065
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:13,083
Stop it! Just, please! I hate it!

1066
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:16,000
I positively hate it
when you take on like this.

1067
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,750
-I don't follow your drift, Mother.
-Oh, no, I'm sure you don't.

1068
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:21,875
I might drift clear to the other side
of the Hudson and no one would care.

1069
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,583
No one would follow!

1070
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,458
-Would they, Daniel?
-[Dr. Marquis] Son, please.

1071
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,041
[sobbing]

1072
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:35,875
[door slams]

1073
01:18:36,416 --> 01:18:40,416
You'll… have to forgive my wife.

1074
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:45,250
Mr. Ballinger's death

1075
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:50,291
has cast a pall
over our happy little clan.

1076
01:18:58,041 --> 01:19:02,458
I wonder if you'd care
to join me in my study, Mr. Landor?

1077
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:03,541
I'd be delighted.

1078
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:14,250
[Dr. Marquis] My apologies, constable.

1079
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:20,791
Living on pins and needles
has taken its toll on all of us.

1080
01:19:20,875 --> 01:19:23,041
-No need to apologize.
-[chuckles softly] Yeah.

1081
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:28,375
And the time of year,
all this confinement…

1082
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:31,791
Mmm. It is all very understandable.

1083
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:39,541
I couldn't help noticing, doctor.

1084
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:44,208
Is your daughter unwell?

1085
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:47,208
Quite observant.

1086
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:49,458
Yes.

1087
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:52,708
Yes, she's…

1088
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,791
She's had a rough go of it, that one.

1089
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,541
Since she was a pup, really.

1090
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:06,583
A ghastly illness
seizing her when no one is looking,

1091
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:11,750
stopping her brain
and shaking her like a gourd.

1092
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,291
Beautiful child.

1093
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:20,125
One marked for marriage, status, children.

1094
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,583
And in the same stroke, illness.

1095
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:27,500
[piano playing faintly outside]

1096
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,125
'Tis dreadful.

1097
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:32,458
[door opens]

1098
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:37,000
Gentlemen, Lea is in fine form
if you'd join us.

1099
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,208
Thank you, son.

1100
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:43,541
Shall we?

1101
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:48,250
If you don't mind,
I'll just step out for some fresh air.

1102
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,291
Of course.

[Artemus] Father, have a game with me.

1105
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,166
[Dr. Marquis]
Shall I try the scholars again

1106
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:07,000
or something more challenging this time?

1107

-Just remarkable.
-Hardly.

1112
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:10,208
Passable, maybe.

1113
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:14,416
You don't realize the effect
your playing has on me.

1114
01:23:16,166 --> 01:23:18,166
On all of us, really, I…

1115
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:23,208
-Yes?
-Well, I…

1116
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:33,333
I don't quite know how else to put it,
but, um… I've come to realize

1117
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,708
that I would do most anything for you.

1118
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:45,958
Oh, Edgar.

1119
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:52,125
[suspenseful music playing]

1120
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:13,500
[Julia] May I help you
find something, Mr. Landor?

1121
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,500
You've recovered. And so soon.

1122
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:19,791
Well, do forgive me.

1123
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:23,791
I feared I was coming down with
one of those horrid migraines,

1124
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:28,333
but it seems a moment's rest
was all I required.

1125
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:31,375
And I feel quite cured. Mmm.

1126
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:37,708
Let's put that dreadful,
old thing away, shall we?

1127
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:40,125
I'm quite sure it won't fit you.

1128
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:44,333
The good doctor and I
were in search of it.

1129
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:46,208
And I found it.

1130
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:52,083
[Julia] Look what the constable
found in our closet, darling.

1131
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:58,083
Remember Artemus wearing it
as a young lad around the house?

1132
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:00,208
Remember, love?

1133
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:02,500
-I remember, Mother.
-It's my brother's coat.

1134
01:25:02,583 --> 01:25:03,833
Your brother's?

1135
01:25:03,916 --> 01:25:06,500
That's the only thing
we have to remember him by.

1136
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:08,791
-[knocking on door]
-Why do you have it?

1137
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,500
Perhaps Artemus can answer that.

1138
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:14,833
[door opens and closes]

1139

[Eugenia] Everyone is in the salon.

01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:22,916
[Dr. Marquis] Ethan.

1141
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:26,166
What brings you here?

1142
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:28,875
Another cadet is missing.

1143
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:35,250
And I've formed a search party
ready to go within the hour.

1144
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:37,458
No stone will be left unturned.

1145
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:39,583
[Thayer] God help us. I shudder to think--

1146
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:40,500
[Landor] Gentlemen!

1147
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:43,375
I've just been to Mr. Stoddard's quarters.

1148
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:48,166
His trunk was empty. No civilian clothes
were to be found anywhere.

1149
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,375
I believe he has run off.

1150
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,500
Run off?

1151
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:54,750
Fry's diary allows

1152
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:58,791
that both Stoddard and Ballinger
were good mates with Leroy Fry.

1153
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,958
Fearing he might be next, I think he ran.

1154
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:04,708
Well, that may well be, but what about
Artemus and the officer's coat?

1155
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:08,250
If he's involved, how can
we possibly delay arresting him?

1156
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:13,208
He is… too cool a customer for that.
All he has to do is deny it.

1157
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:17,291
Now, there's a last avenue
of inquiry I'm exploring.

1158
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:19,750
Two of his closest companions are dead,

1159
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:23,083
and imminently, I must report
to the president that we have our man.

1160
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,333
We have our man, Landor. Do we not?

1161
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,708
[dramatic music playing]

-[Poe] I, uh…
-[Landor] <i>Professor?</i>

1165
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Pépé?

1166
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:05,875
Last time I was here,
you mentioned a witch hunter and a book.

1167
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:08,791
Yes. <i>Discours du Diable.</i>

1168
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:10,791
Henri Le Clerc.

1169
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:13,166
Was Le Clerc a priest?

1170
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:15,416
One burned at the stake.

1171

[Poe] <i>It came to me while I slept</i>

Lenore.

Lea.

It speaks of your unspeakable distress.

A conclusion to what's… oppressing you.

is speaking to us.

1190

Remember when you said
you'd do anything for me?

1191

Your family.

1196

Your family… have been

1197
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:22,833
quite a puzzle.

1198
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:29,041
I could never get a fix
of who was in command.

1199
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:32,625
One time or other I suspected each of you.

1200
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:34,750
It never occurred to me

1201
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:40,250
that it might be someone
who wasn't even alive.

1202

[voice shaking] Pardon me?

Father Henri Le Clerc.

1204

Finest of witch hunters,

1205
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:55,083
until he became the hunted.

1206
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:58,250
What are you talking about?

1207
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:04,250
Your daughter, she suffers
from a falling sickness, does she not?

1208
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:08,291
She copes because
she is in contact with someone.

1209
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,791
Someone who instructs her.

1210
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:14,041
Him.

1211
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:19,375
Do not make me question
your sanity, Mr. Landor.

1212
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:21,666
Uh, what are you suggesting?

1213
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:33,833
Le Clerc's incredibly rare
<i>Discours du Diable.</i>

1214
01:30:37,916 --> 01:30:42,500
Well, communicating with the devil

1215
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:47,083
is not a pastime
with which I am familiar, Mr. Landor.

1216
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:50,958
[hesitating]
I have never read a page of this book.

1217
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:55,541
Does your daughter speak with the dead?!

1218

I…

1221
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:25,083
I have tried
every medical regimen I could think of.

She was given three months to live.

1223

Do you know
what it feels like to go to sleep,

1224
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:35,208
not knowing if your daughter
will make it through the night?

1225
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:39,625
But then, one day she came to me,

1226
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:44,583
and said that she'd met someone.

1227
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,875
Her great-great-grandfather.

1228
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:48,416
Le Clerc?

1229
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:51,041
Henri Le Clerc wasn't evil.

1230
01:31:53,291 --> 01:31:55,333
He… He was misunderstood.

They swore to me Mr. Fry was already dead.

1235
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,083
They swore they could never kill anyone.

1236
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:57,125
You believed them.

1237
01:32:57,208 --> 01:32:58,791
I had no choice.

1238
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:01,791
You are a physician! A man of science!

1239
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:05,125
How dare you
put your faith in such madness?

1240
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,041
Because…

1241
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:11,000
Because I… I… I couldn't save her myself.

1242
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:14,208
My own art had failed me.

1243
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:19,500
I sacrificed everything for my Lea.

1244
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:23,250
So how can I then object
to her finding a cure elsewhere?

Doctor.

1246

Communicating with the dead…

1247
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:32,333
that's not normal. But murder…

1248
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,333
destroying innocent lives…

1249
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,750
that's inhuman.

1250

Someone has to hang for this.

she seemed to improve.

1254

But I wish to convey

that if this business
has ever rendered me…

1352
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:54,750
Which is to say, if ever out
of impertinence, I have impugned…

with the man all of these years?

Known his family almost as well as my own

1358

and never fathomed
the depths of their distress.

I can only assume
Artemus murdered Mr. Ballinger

1363

to prevent him
from alerting the authorities,

1364

and Mr. Stoddard ran
rather than become the next victim.

fulfilled to the letter.

you won't object to accepting our thanks.

The note left for him
luring the poor bloke from his barracks.

You were careless enough
to leave that with me.

The A, the R, the G and the E,

1393

virtually identical to the ones
found in Leroy Fry's note.

You can imagine my astonishment.

1395
01:45:13,833 --> 01:45:17,416
Could the same man
have written both notes?

1396
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:23,791
And why would Landor have
any reason to correspond with Leroy Fry?

So what did I do next?

01:49:34,125 --> 01:49:37,291
Exactly what you would have done.

1451
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:40,541
Examined all assumptions, beginning with

1452

what were the chances that two parties

1453
01:49:44,166 --> 01:49:48,750
would have had designs
on the same cadet in the same evening?

Small!

Small indeed!

1456
01:49:53,916 --> 01:49:58,958
Unless we see one party
as being contingent upon the other,

1457
01:49:59,041 --> 01:50:02,041
or what if one party say, Artemus and Lea,

1458
01:50:02,125 --> 01:50:05,875
what if they were simply
on the lookout for a dead body.

1459
01:50:05,958 --> 01:50:08,125
And then the opportunity
magically appears,

1460
01:50:08,208 --> 01:50:11,958
and they don't care who the body is,
provided it had a heart.

1461
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:15,208
The one thing
they won't do for it is kill.

1462
01:50:15,291 --> 01:50:19,416
No, it is the other party
who is ready and willing to kill.

1463
01:50:21,458 --> 01:50:23,708
And to kill this man in particular.

But he's shocked at being summoned back
to West Point the very next day

1483

to learn that in the intervening hours,

the dead man's body
has been most horribly mutilated.

Hmm.

He must think God himself was on his side.

Being engaged to solve
the very crimes that he himself committed.

00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,250
‎你擅長解密、鎮壓暴動

24
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,291
‎以及非暴力審問

25
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,083
‎你來自格洛斯特，父親是牧師

26
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,500
‎你青少年時期就來到紐約

27
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,583
‎而且你是名鰥夫，蘭道先生

28
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:33,750
‎喪妻三年了

29
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:39,125
‎-要來杯咖啡嗎？
‎-啤酒就行了

30
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,666
‎你…

31
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:54,666
‎你把這些筆記
‎放在某個櫃子裡，對吧？

32
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,000
‎上面還寫些什麼？

33
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,958
‎有沒有寫說我已多年

34
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,666
‎沒有上教堂了？

35
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:07,000
‎有沒有提到小女之前離家出走了？

36
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,583
‎我們清楚令嬡失蹤一事

37
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,250
‎對此深表同情

38
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:18,541
‎恕我直言，我無意冒犯

39
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,208
‎不會

40
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,583
‎不好意思，該道歉的是我

41
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:27,375
‎很抱歉，請繼續

42
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,083
‎蘭道先生，我們必須極度低調行事

43
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,708
‎我們想找一個人

44
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:38,375
‎一個資深老練的普通公民

45
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,958
‎能代表軍校收集情報

46
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,625
‎事關敏感議題，非常複雜

47
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,333
‎且牽扯到我們的一名學員

48
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,458
‎來自肯塔基州的二年級生，名叫弗萊

49
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,916
‎-李洛弗萊
‎-沒必要兜圈子了

50
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,041
‎弗萊昨晚上吊自殺

51
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,541
‎我深感遺憾

52
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:12,458
‎此事非常不幸
‎但你必須明白我們的立場

53
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:16,541
‎大家將這些年輕人的未來
‎寄託在我們手上

54
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:20,708
‎期望我們把他們教導成紳士和士兵
‎因此我們必須鞭策他們

55
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:26,000
‎但我們應該懂得適可而止

56
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,750
‎一名男孩上吊自盡

57
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,750
‎-這應該要找驗屍官
‎-事情恐怕沒那麼簡單

58
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:41,500
‎弗萊學員的屍體昨晚在醫院遭侵犯

59
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,541
‎侵犯？遭誰侵犯？

60
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,958
‎要是我們知道的話，就不必請你來了

61
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:51,833
‎相信貴校也有不少惡作劇之徒

62
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,500
‎蘭道先生，此非單純的惡作劇

63
00:05:56,375 --> 00:06:00,125
‎李洛弗萊的心臟被挖了出來

64
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:07,291
‎馬奎斯醫生，對方用了什麼工具？

65
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:13,708
‎解剖刀，或任何尖銳的刀都行

66
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:18,458
‎但要把心臟挖出來可不容易

67
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:24,416
‎他的肺部和肝臟被深深劃開

68
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,625
‎是因為刀子要以特定角度切入
‎才得以保存心臟

69
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:31,541
‎那要怎麼保存心臟？

70
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,375
‎用某種容器盛裝吧

71
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:38,541
‎也許是用棉布或報紙包覆

72
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,666
‎再拿去冰鎮

73
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,916
‎哪種人辦得到這種事？

74
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:47,708
‎力氣大的人

75
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,500
‎所以不會是女人了？

76
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:53,083
‎我從未有榮幸見過這樣的女人

77
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,708
‎那醫學背景呢？

78
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,708
‎他必須是像你一樣
‎受過多年教育與訓練的專業人士嗎？

79
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,416
‎未必

80
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,083
‎他需要充足的光線
‎也必須知道在哪裡下刀

81
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:11,500
‎但不需要是醫生或外科醫生

82
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,166
‎-他肯定是…
‎-瘋子

83
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,833
‎逍遙法外的瘋子

84
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,000
‎端槍

85
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:22,541
‎蘭道先生，請見諒

86
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,958
‎我們現在處境艱難

87
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,583
‎華府某些有權勢的參議員

88
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,791
‎巴不得我們出紕漏，好關閉軍校

89
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:40,583
‎懇請你挽救美國軍校的榮譽

90
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,125
‎我會竭盡所能

91
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:51,333
‎杭圖先生，你昨晚負責看守

92
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,458
‎是的

93
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:56,375
‎9點30分值班，午夜便返回衛兵室

94
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,625
‎衛兵室在哪裡？

95
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,333
‎四號，柯林頓堡旁

96
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,125
‎我承認我不熟悉校地

97
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,916
‎但我們腳下這塊地

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,583
‎似乎不在柯林頓堡到北營的路上

99
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,708
‎-沒錯
‎-你為何繞路？

100
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,500
‎我在途中耳聞動靜

101
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:17,875
‎我猜是動物的叫聲

102
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,375
‎聽起來像奄奄一息
‎或被困在陷阱中，於是我就跑來救援

103
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,541
‎我很喜歡動物

104
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:29,416
‎我往這裡的方向跑
‎途中與弗萊擦身而過

105
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,833
‎-他看起來如何？
‎-有恙

106
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,250
‎他上吊的姿勢不對勁

107
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,916
‎看起來彷彿坐在椅子上

108
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,666
‎我不明白

109
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,458
‎他的腳當時是著地的

110
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,875
‎-他的腳著地？
‎-是的

111
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:53,625
‎好，那你接下來做了什麼？

112
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,541
‎跑走，馬上跑回北營

113
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,875
‎再問你最後一個問題

114
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:06,333
‎你還有看見其他人嗎？

115
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,041
‎沒有

116
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,166
‎杭圖先生

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
‎脖子…

118
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,583
‎這是第一個疑點

119
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,208
‎看到沒？

120
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,000
‎有多條勒痕，繩子勒緊他的脖子

121
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:33,083
‎但是不斷上下移動，尋找施力點

122
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,583
‎彷彿…

123
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:37,416
‎彷彿他當時在…掙扎

124
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,583
‎再來看看他的手指

125
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,208
‎因抓繩子而起水泡

126
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:50,125
‎努力想掙脫繩子

127
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,416
‎請問這是怎麼回事？

128
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,875
‎這很不尋常

129
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:01,500
‎若你不介意的話
‎可否摸一摸弗萊先生的後腦勺？

130
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,833
‎你有檢驗弗萊先生的屍體嗎？

131
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,916
‎當然有，那是我的工作

132
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,125
‎我們不是已經討論過了嗎？

133
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,250
‎這裡有某種挫傷

134
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,625
‎在頂骨的區域

135
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,875
‎約八公分長

136
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,791
‎一定是我遺漏掉了

137
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,791
‎弗萊先生是遭謀殺的

138
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,000
‎蘭道先生，這是你的意思嗎？

139
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,166
‎希區考克上尉，很有可能

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,166
‎醫生，誰都可能遺漏掉這個

141
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,666
‎蘭道先生

142
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,500
‎既然你同意加入調查

143
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,083
‎我想我們應該制定一些基本規範

144
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,750
‎你必須每天向我呈報
‎我再向上校呈報

145
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:54,666
‎而且不得向校內
‎或校外任何人提及此事

146
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,666
‎-就這樣嗎？
‎-還有最後一個條件

147
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,875
‎你在調查過程中必須滴酒不沾

148
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,250
‎大家都知道你有酗酒的問題

149
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:35,875
‎不好意思

150
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,416
‎-你是奧古斯特蘭道嗎？
‎-是的

151
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
‎若我沒誤會的話，你負責調查

152
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,125
‎李洛弗萊的死亡案件

153
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,416
‎沒錯，有何貴幹？

154
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,250
‎為了這間學校的榮譽，我有義務分享

155
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,583
‎我所得到的一些結論

156
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,625
‎結論？

157
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,000
‎針對弗萊死亡一事

158
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,625
‎我洗耳恭聽

159
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,333
‎你要找的人

160
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,250
‎是一名詩人

161
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,583
‎考科藍二等兵

162
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,666
‎李洛弗萊的屍體被帶回醫院時

163
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,333
‎是由你負責看守？

164
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,625
‎是的，警探

165
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,791
‎-看守期間有何異樣？
‎-一直到2點30分才有

166
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,708
‎-我被卸除職務
‎-誰下的令？

167
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:38,333
‎-二等兵，是誰下的令？
‎-我也不知道

168
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:40,916
‎我只知道是一名軍官

169
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,541
‎-他沒有透露自己的身分？
‎-沒有，警探

170
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,291
‎但軍官沒必要對我多作解釋

171
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,333
‎這名軍官對你說了什麼？

172
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,541
‎他說：“二等兵，謝謝，你可以走了
‎我要卸除你的職務”

173
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:00,291
‎-你不感到不尋常嗎？
‎-是的，很不尋常

174
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,666
‎-你有看到這名軍官的臉嗎？
‎-沒有

175
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,958
‎我手上只有一根蠟燭，當時天色很暗

176
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,583
‎好吧，那你怎麼知道對方是軍官？

177
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:15,416
‎因為他肩上的橫槓
‎但我必須承認，那非常古怪

178
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,375
‎-怎麼說？
‎-那些橫槓

179
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,708
‎他左肩上的橫槓不見了

180
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,916
‎歡迎你大駕光臨

181
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,958
‎一看就知道你需要來一杯

182
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:49,125
‎光看到酒就全身暖和起來了

183
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,375
‎-班尼
‎-是

184
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,750
‎-敬…規範
‎-管他的規範

185
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,625
‎派希

186
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,458
‎派希

187
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,541
‎怎麼愁眉苦臉的？

188
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,958
‎你聽說那可憐的學員的事了嗎？

189
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,583
‎-他們說他過了好幾小時後才死
‎-“他們”？

190
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:17,666
‎他

191
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,083
‎你不是該去參加獨奏會嗎？

192
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,750
‎晚安，獨奏會？

193
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,291
‎不，沒有人在乎我去不去

194
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,791
‎我在軍校裡沒沒無聞

195
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:45,000
‎況且，我在這種地方學到的東西
‎比教室學到的還多

196
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,250
‎我相信你

197
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:50,875
‎請坐，請坐下來，請就…

198
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,875
‎-座
‎-對，謝謝

199
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:56,708
‎我是四年級生，叫愛倫坡

200
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,208
‎埃德加愛倫坡

201
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,333
‎看來你口很渴

202
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,041
‎借酒消愁嘛

203
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:17,833
‎你是怎麼知道李洛弗萊的事的？

204
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,333
‎當然是從杭圖口中得知的

205
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:25,625
‎他像個傳報員一樣，不斷散播消息

206
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,916
‎也許不久會有人吊死他

207
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,916
‎你是否暗指有人吊死弗萊先生？

208
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,916
‎我沒有暗指任何事情

209
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:43,458
‎你為何認為
‎把李洛弗萊的心臟挖出來的人

210
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:45,166
‎是一名詩人？

211
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:46,791
‎這個嘛…

212
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,750
‎心臟若非象徵，就什麼也不是

213
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:54,583
‎去除象徵意義的話，還剩下什麼？

214
00:16:56,291 --> 00:17:00,791
‎僅剩下一團肌肉
‎長得跟膀胱沒什麼兩樣

215
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,083
‎移除一個人的心臟是一大罪行

216
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,250
‎而除了詩人以外，還有誰更有能力

217
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:09,875
‎做這件事？

218
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,750
‎這名詩人也太沒有想像力了吧…

219
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,333
‎你無法否認這項殘暴之舉

220
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:21,958
‎會驚動你心深處的文學迴響

221
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,041
‎套用約翰蘇克林那首迷人的歌曲

222
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:31,125
‎“既然得不到你的心
‎那就把我的心還來”

223
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,333
‎甚至是《聖經》

224
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,291
‎“上帝啊，請為我造一顆純潔的心”

225
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,416
‎“憂傷痛悔的心，你必不輕看”

226
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:44,500
‎那凶手很可能是個信教的瘋子

227
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:49,208
‎不，聽好了，我忘了告訴你
‎我也是一名詩人

228
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,916
‎因此也擁有詩人的思維

229
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,333
‎我不常讀詩

230
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,875
‎何必呢？你是美國人

231
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,541
‎那你呢？

232
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:03,916
‎我是藝術家，不屬於任何國家

233
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,083
‎笑什麼，蘭道先生？

234
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,708
‎感謝你的幫忙

235
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:16,916
‎去調查一名叫拉夫堡的學員

236
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:22,833
‎他曾是李洛弗萊的室友
‎但他們之間鬧得不愉快

237
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:27,375
‎起因不明

238
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,708
‎拉夫堡先生

239
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:53,208
‎請向蘭道先生說明
‎你是如何認識弗萊先生的

240
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,000
‎好的，我們原本是室友

241
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,750
‎有鬧得不愉快嗎？

242
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,833
‎也不是鬧得不愉快，只是…

243
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,625
‎我們決定各走各的路

244
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,958
‎基於什麼原因？

245
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,208
‎也沒什麼，就…

246
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,416
‎自然而然地如此

247
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,916
‎若你知道任何有關弗萊先生的事

248
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,833
‎必須據實以告

249
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,583
‎是這樣的

250
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,958
‎我會說他結交了一群

251
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,833
‎壞朋友

252
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,166
‎至少他是這麼形容的

253
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:43,041
‎那告訴我，“壞朋友”
‎指的是其他的學員嗎？

254
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:46,333
‎他沒多說，但我是這麼猜想的

255
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,583
‎你為何不早點告訴我們？

256
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:52,041
‎我沒想到兩者會有所關聯

257
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,291
‎畢竟這是很久以前的事了

258
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
‎你可以走了

259
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,750
‎斯達德先生

260
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,625
‎你是弗萊生前最後一個看到他的人

261
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,166
‎是的，長官

262
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,583
‎-說話大聲點
‎-我有點不舒服

263
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,125
‎我確實在案發當晚深夜看見李洛

264
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,500
‎在回營房的路上與他擦肩而過

265
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,208
‎你跟他說過話嗎？

266
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,625
‎他把我攔下來，問我附近有沒有軍官

267
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,833
‎弗萊先生神態如何？

268
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:34,875
‎當時很暗，我記不清楚

269
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:39,083
‎你有沒有看到他身上拿著一條繩子？

270
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,166
‎就我所知沒有

271
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,958
‎倒是有一件事

272
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,875
‎弗萊離開前，我問他這麼晚要去哪

273
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
‎然後呢？

274
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,500
‎他說：“處理要事”

275
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,458
‎你認為那是什麼意思？

276
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,166
‎不知道

277
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,541
‎你可以走了

278
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,750
‎-上尉，打擾了
‎-什麼事？

279
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,875
‎老天

280
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:37,416
‎“冷泉有一頭牛和一隻羊遭殘殺肢解

281
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,000
‎其胸腔遭殘忍地切開，心臟被挖出”

282
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,583
‎難道這人不放過任何一個生靈嗎？

283
00:21:45,666 --> 00:21:48,208
‎我們無法確定這出自同一個人之手

284
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:50,125
‎什麼？

285
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,416
‎這只是巧合嗎？

286
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:58,000
‎明早6點開始

287
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:03,291
‎所有人員只能去上課
‎吃飯及參加禱告會

288
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:04,958
‎其餘活動一律禁止

289
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,583
‎若你的同學問起

290
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:20,583
‎我們僅談到你和李洛弗萊的關係

291
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,166
‎我跟他毫無關係，我不認識他

292
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,833
‎-什麼？
‎-我不認識那個人

293
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,541
‎-看來我誤會你了
‎-你也不是第一個誤會我的人

294
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,708
‎若你不是來找我討論案情
‎那你找我做什麼？

295
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,125
‎我要雇用你

296
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,250
‎不過沒有酬勞

297
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:40,458
‎也不能讓你的同學知道你在做什麼

298
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,750
‎直到你早已完成任務

299
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:47,583
‎要是他們發現了
‎也很有可能會辱罵你

300
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:50,250
‎真是個令人無法抗拒的條件

301
00:22:51,541 --> 00:22:53,875
‎不，請繼續說

302
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,500
‎好極了，我要請你破解
‎一小段不完整的字條

303
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:04,000
‎你必須暗中行事，也必須非常精準

304
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,791
‎好消息，我破解了你給我的訊息

305
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:11,166
‎是手寫的，攸關私事

306
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,583
‎事發當晚，弗萊將其帶在身上

307
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:15,833
‎我們可從中推斷

308
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:19,083
‎這張字條足以在案發當晚
‎將他引出營房

309
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,208
‎因其餘的訊息從他的手中被撕走

310
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:25,875
‎我們可以推斷
‎這張字條能揭露作者身分

311
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,833
‎對方以粗糙的方式寫出黑色大寫字母

312
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:32,750
‎也顯示作者想刻意隱藏身分

313
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:38,125
‎這是某種邀約
‎或者更準確來說是圈套

314
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,375
‎圈套？

315
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:45,458
‎清楚了這點之後…可以借我嗎？

316
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,708
‎我們把注意力集中在第三行

317
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,833
‎因為那是完整的字

318
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,416
‎“Be”，但後面接的是什麼？

319
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,541
‎某個L開頭的字

320
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,458
‎“小”？“幸運”？

321
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:04,125
‎不對，這都跟邀約無關

322
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:09,000
‎“處於迷失”？不對，這文法太鬆散了

323
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:13,125
‎若對方希望李洛弗萊
‎在特定的時間地點出現

324
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,958
‎那就只有一個可能，“遲到”

325
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,958
‎“遲到”

326
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,208
‎看一看第三行

327
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:24,458
‎第一個字就太好猜了

328
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:26,041
‎答案就是“別”

329
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:29,625
‎所以是“別遲到”

330
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,791
‎蘭道先生，仔細看

331
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,333
‎我們快要找出合適的人選了

332
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:40,333
‎若弗萊要前往一個既定地點

333
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:43,916
‎那從作者的觀點來說，他要過來了

334
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,041
‎所以是“來吧，弗萊先生”

335
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:50,125
‎破解完這一句之後，想都不用想

336
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:53,625
‎就知道下一個字一定會是“快點”

337
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:56,125
‎拼湊起來就大功告成

338
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:57,875
‎“別遲到，快點來”

339
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:02,083
‎完成了，我要把這個小小謎團的解答

340
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:04,166
‎交給你

341
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,625
‎了不起，謝謝你

342
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,333
‎-我只有一個問題
‎-嗯？

343
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:18,750
‎前兩行破解出來了嗎？

344
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,416
‎我不得不知難而退

345
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:23,583
‎你很會拼字嗎？

346
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,000
‎我拼字能力一流
‎而且我還有權威作證

347
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,250
‎斯托克紐因頓的約翰布蘭斯比牧師

348
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:35,875
‎那我猜你從來沒有犯過常人的錯誤

349
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:39,791
‎把同音字的拼法搞混

350
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:46,916
‎比方說，“他們是”、“他們的”
‎還有“那裡”

351
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,000
‎常見的謬誤

352
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,625
‎這的確是邀約，“在那裡和我碰面”

353
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:57,125
‎當然我們還不知道碰面地點，對吧？

354
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:02,041
‎但我們知道結尾是字母N和G

355
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:04,958
‎碼頭！

356
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,750
‎-而且是碼頭旁的海灣
‎-猜得好

357
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:14,958
‎所以是“我會在碼頭旁的海灣”

358
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,125
‎“在晚上11點到那裡和我碰面”

359
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:21,541
‎所以比較可能是“不要遲到，來見我”

360
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,625
‎你覺得這是什麼線索嗎？

361
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:28,083
‎他明明可以在任何地方和學員碰面

362
00:27:28,958 --> 00:27:30,541
‎何必大費周章跑去碼頭？

363
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:37,500
‎因為對方不是學員，而是個女人

364
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:43,500
‎蘭道先生，你一直都知道答案

365
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:44,708
‎那只是我的推論

366
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:49,125
‎若我們要找的真的是名女人

367
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:54,083
‎那我相信我已經看過她了

368
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:00,625
‎李洛弗萊遇害隔日早晨
‎在我得知消息前

369
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:07,250
‎我一醒來，即開始朗誦
‎一首詩的開場白

370
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:14,041
‎這段開場白講述的是
‎一名悲痛無比的神祕女子

371
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:20,625
‎接著，食堂外面出現了一位

372
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:24,083
‎我生平見過最美麗的女人

373
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,750
‎她是誰？

374
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,958
‎我毫無頭緒

375
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:37,791
‎但你為何相信這首詩或那名女子
‎和弗萊先生有關？

376
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,916
‎不為人知的暴行

377
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,625
‎無可告人的威迫

378
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,750
‎一名陌生女子

379
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:51,291
‎你在任何一個早上
‎都有可能寫出這首詩

380
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:55,166
‎但那不是我寫的，是別人叫我寫的

381
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:56,625
‎別人叫你寫的？

382
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,125
‎誰叫你寫的？

383
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:03,500
‎我母親

384
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,041
‎她已不在人間

385
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,083
‎死了將近20年

386
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:21,750
‎跟我說說坡這個人怎麼樣

387
00:29:24,583 --> 00:29:26,000
‎小坡啊

388
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,541
‎很可愛的一個男孩

389
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:35,583
‎彬彬有禮、口若懸河

390
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:40,583
‎沒錯，而且他這個人很不尋常

391
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,791
‎因為他話很多？

392
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:45,291
‎不是，因為他只會做一些
‎毫無邏輯的幻想

393
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,000
‎他宣稱有一首詩

394
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,916
‎和李洛弗萊之死有關

395
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,958
‎還宣稱那首詩
‎是他亡母在他睡夢中叫他寫的

396
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:10,375
‎在所有人之中，你應該最清楚
‎那些逝去的亡魂

397
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:14,125
‎永遠與我們同在

398
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,583
‎人為了逃過死劫，什麼事都做得出來

399
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,166
‎用某種容器盛裝吧

400
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:27,708
‎也許是用棉布或報紙包覆

401
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,375
‎再拿去冰鎮

402
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:47,750
‎（到冰窖碰面，鼓起勇氣）

403
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:55,000
‎很好，你收到我的字條了

404
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,791
‎-有人跟蹤你嗎？
‎-跟蹤？

405
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,708
‎太不專業了，當然沒有

406
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:05,791
‎-這是什麼？
‎-犯案現場

407
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,833
‎第二次犯案

408
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,750
‎弗萊的心臟被帶來這裡

409
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:16,500
‎你提到弗萊的心臟被挖出
‎讓你聯想到《聖經》

410
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,208
‎不得不承認，我早就往那方向推斷了

411
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,916
‎只不過不是《聖經》

412
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,958
‎而是宗教

413
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:30,291
‎這確實看起來像某種儀式

414
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:33,875
‎血和蠟燭以特定方式擺設

415
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:41,291
‎-圓圈
‎-還有三角形

416
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:47,833
‎弗萊的心臟很可能被放在裡面

417
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:56,708
‎我有個老朋友可能幫得上忙

418
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:09,000
‎尚恩佩裴教授專攻符號…

419
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,708
‎-佩裴
‎-…儀式和神祕學

420
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,333
‎-教授
‎-佩裴可說是

421
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:16,916
‎-我這輩子見過…
‎-請進，我在後面這裡

422
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,125
‎-抱歉打擾
‎-…最古怪的人

423
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:24,625
‎我帶來一個奇特的東西，想給你看看

424
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:30,041
‎這一定是魔法陣

425
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:34,208
‎我記得曾在《紅龍》中看過

426
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:37,708
‎若沒記錯，魔法師會站在

427
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,333
‎三角形裡面

428
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,083
‎獨自一人？

429
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,833
‎他可能有一些助手

430
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,875
‎兩邊放滿蠟燭、火把，到處都有光

431
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,916
‎堪稱一場光之饗宴

432
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:55,416
‎古斯，到第三個書櫃

433
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:58,125
‎從上面數來第二層櫃子

434
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,125
‎最上面的那本書

435
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,375
‎就是那本

436
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:11,583
‎皮埃爾德朗克，可怕的獵巫者

437
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,208
‎-坡先生，你會讀法文嗎？
‎-會

438
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,250
‎安靜地讀吧，在中間那一頁

439
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:25,916
‎德朗克將600名巴斯克女巫處死

440
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,666
‎並留下你手中的那本巨作

441
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,291
‎但我想給你的書是
‎亨利勒克的《魔鬼話語》

442
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:38,125
‎他在寫完之前處決了700名女巫

443
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,958
‎但書據說已遭摧毀

444
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:44,541
‎傳聞遭摧毀的那本書

445
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,916
‎還有兩三份一模一樣的版本

446
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:53,000
‎對許多神祕學家來說
‎那本書可是求之不得

447
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:55,416
‎-為什麼？
‎-為什麼？

448
00:37:57,416 --> 00:38:01,958
‎勒克在書中留下了…

449
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,250
‎長生不死的祕方

450
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,875
‎天啊

451
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,125
‎“惡天使之中常言

452
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,833
‎女巫在安息日的饗宴上

453
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:20,041
‎僅能準備以下食材

454
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:24,458
‎基督教徒絕不吃的污穢動物

455
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,291
‎未受洗過的孩童心臟

456
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:33,333
‎以及上吊者的心臟”

457
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,958
‎我需要你悄悄滲入軍校

458
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,791
‎看誰跟神祕學有關聯

459
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:55,708
‎有話快說

460
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:59,125
‎近日有人對我作出一項提議

461
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:01,958
‎相當黑暗且有違基督教的提議

462
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:03,000
‎-有違基督教？
‎-是

463
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:06,000
‎我因此質疑自己的信仰

464
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:09,833
‎開始鑽研古老神祕學

465
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:12,791
‎-神祕學？
‎-他是指黑魔法，是誰？

466
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:16,208
‎-告訴我們
‎-我發誓不透露他的名字

467
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:17,125
‎到底是誰？

468
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,416
‎怎麼問我都不會回答

469
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,625
‎就算上帝親自威嚇我
‎我也會守口如瓶

470
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:24,333
‎-你可以和我們一同禱告
‎-不，我答應對方了

471
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,166
‎-當有人要你質疑信仰…
‎-我不能張揚

472
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,333
‎是馬奎斯嗎？

473
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,458
‎漢彌頓，別亂說話

474
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:34,791
‎這下有名字了，但必須找到對應的臉

475
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
‎眩暈？

476
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,666
‎我整個頭暈目眩

477
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,625
‎你的心跳很快

478
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:58,375
‎好吧，坡先生，今天待在室內

479
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:00,125
‎好好照顧自己

480
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:05,791
‎把這個拿給洛克中尉及他的班長

481
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,041
‎亞提莫斯，我兒子

482
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:12,333
‎他會幫你卸除你今日的職務

483
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,250
‎你今天無法上課，因為你感到

484
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,333
‎眩暈？

485
00:40:20,916 --> 00:40:23,375
‎我還有一個更嚴重的病痛

486
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,458
‎一股強大的厭倦感

487
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:27,958
‎“強大的厭倦感”？

488
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:30,416
‎令我極度不適

489
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,000
‎坡，小心點

490
00:40:32,083 --> 00:40:33,875
‎你可以自己去問醫生

491
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:38,500
‎中尉，是真的

492
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:41,791
‎家父的確跟我說
‎他從未見過如此嚴重的症狀

493
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:42,875
‎好吧

494
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:47,166
‎但我要因你的厚顏無恥懲罰你

495
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,666
‎扣三分

496
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,666
‎立刻返回營房

497
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,833
‎軍官巡房時，你最好沒跑掉

498
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,916
‎-你叫坡嗎？
‎-是的

499
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,375
‎亞提莫斯馬奎斯

500
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:16,000
‎不得不說
‎你如此明目張膽真令人佩服

501
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:21,083
‎今晚11點在北營18號碰面

502
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:28,916
‎抱歉晚到，希望沒讓你等太久

503
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,708
‎這裡真棒

504
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,750
‎好多書！

505
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,458
‎你完全提起了我的興趣

506
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:44,208
‎該從哪裡開始呢？

507
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:51,958
‎差強人意的菲尼莫爾庫柏
‎不過這也算是必收藏的經典吧

508
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,416
‎真是坐擁書城

509
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:58,041
‎《埃及史》，琳瑯滿目

510
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,416
‎我識破你了

511
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:11,000
‎你讓我以為你不讀詩

512
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,791
‎我確實不讀詩

513
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:15,916
‎拜倫

514
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:19,916
‎-這是我個人的最愛，蘭道先生…
‎-麻煩你

515
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
‎…而且書都被翻爛了

516
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,708
‎那是我女兒的

517
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:37,375
‎令嬡已不在？

518
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:40,958
‎對，她跟別人跑了

519
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:43,541
‎你認識對方嗎？

520
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:45,875
‎不熟

521
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:48,291
‎而她不會再回來了？

522
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:51,791
‎不大可能

523
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,458
‎那我們在這世界上都孤身一人

524
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,541
‎但你還有你母親

525
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,833
‎她仍會跟你說話

526
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,166
‎-儘管她死了
‎-是啊

527
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,541
‎是的，她不時會和我說話

528
00:43:07,375 --> 00:43:12,541
‎順便一提，我所有的優點都是來自她

529
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:19,250
‎令嬡，冒昧請問，她叫什麼名字？

530
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:22,583
‎瑪蒂達

531
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:26,875
‎小瑪

532
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,333
‎蘭道先生，你不必多說了

533
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:40,583
‎-你說你有所發現
‎-不，不僅如此

534
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:43,916
‎一名叫馬奎斯的人

535
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,416
‎那位醫生

536
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,000
‎不，他的兒子，亞提莫斯

537
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:53,041
‎而我成功進入了他難以滲透的小團體

538
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:57,041
‎我又帶來了一個上帝的造物

539
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:01,250
‎這是美妙的派希送的

540
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:05,750
‎坡，你會通報我們違反宵禁嗎？

541
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:11,375
‎我們稍微打破戒律會冒犯到你嗎？

542
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:16,791
‎貝林傑先生，我不僅沒有被冒犯到
‎我還要…

543
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:21,250
‎再來一輪

544
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:28,583
‎喝下去

545
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:31,833
‎小妞，全喝光

546
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:34,541
‎貝林傑，你今晚真是盛氣凌人

547
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:39,083
‎麻煩你，再來一杯

548
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,375
‎感激不盡

549
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,958
‎我可以喝一整晚

550
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:51,708
‎貝林傑，慢著點

551
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:55,041
‎那可是我費盡千辛萬苦才弄到的

552
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:56,958
‎坡

553
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,000
‎聽說你是出版過作品的詩人

554
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,541
‎人們說我天賦異稟

555
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,791
‎那就來一場誦詩會

556
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:08,666
‎給我們一點消遣

557
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:16,791
‎我在百慕達遇見一名光溜溜的浪女

558
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:19,208
‎她自以為聰明

559
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,250
‎卻略遜我一籌

560
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,791
‎她認為一絲不掛地被追求，太過淫穢

561
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:28,416
‎於是我追上、壓上並搞上她

562
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:31,791
‎-坡，真絕妙
‎-厲害

563
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:32,875
‎了不起

564
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:39,083
‎輸家是七

565
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,333
‎贏家是J

566
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:46,541
‎坡，你今天真幸運

567
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:48,083
‎謝謝

568
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
‎坡，蘭道警探是否真的訊問過你
‎關於弗萊的事？

569
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:59,208
‎他誤以為我和弗萊是至交

570
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,500
‎你們是嗎？

571
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:04,125
‎不是

572
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:08,041
‎不出所料
‎弗萊唯一能引人注意的方法

573
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,541
‎就是上吊自殺

574
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:15,708
‎他應該是因為求愛不成而自殺的

575
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:17,791
‎斯達德，他跟誰求愛？

576
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,708
‎亞提莫斯，那你妹妹呢？

577
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:23,000
‎她是不是讓弗萊一見傾心？

578
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,333
‎拜託，藍迪

579
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,500
‎這裡就你和弗萊最親近

580
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,750
‎最親近他的人

581
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,750
‎是你才對吧

582
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:52,166
‎好了，剛才玩到哪？

583
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:22,458
‎坡

584
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:26,250
‎坡先生，你不必遵守宵禁嗎？

585
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:28,541
‎給我解釋清楚

586
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:32,000
‎你三小時前就該熄燈了

587
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,750
‎對不起，長官

588
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,958
‎你每次道歉都只是空口說白話

589
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:42,375
‎別忘了李洛弗萊是在宵禁過後喪命的

590
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:46,750
‎立刻返回營房

591
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:50,916
‎你還活著就該慶幸了

592
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,458
‎謝謝，長官

593
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,666
‎動作快

594
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:35,416
‎小瑪？

595
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:55,000
‎“主啊，以祢的恩惠和慈愛待我

596
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:59,333
‎因為在死地無人紀念祢

597
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:03,500
‎在陰間有誰稱謝祢？

598
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:06,375
‎主啊，因祢的恩惠

599
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:11,041
‎以祢的恩惠和慈愛待我

600
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,250
‎我因憂愁眼睛乾癟”

601
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:21,708
‎你是蘭道先生，不是嗎？

602
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:23,208
‎是的

603
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:26,125
‎我是李洛的母親

604
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:31,041
‎請你收下這個

605
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:33,166
‎李洛的日記

606
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:36,875
‎他記錄了過去三年的生活點滴

607
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,166
‎我不記得…

608
00:50:40,291 --> 00:50:41,375
‎很抱歉

609
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,166
‎請節哀

610
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:50,916
‎我不記得他的私物中有日記

611
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,875
‎是貝林傑先生寄給我的

612
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,250
‎-貝林傑先生？
‎-是的

613
00:50:55,916 --> 00:50:58,000
‎他一得知死訊

614
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:01,625
‎就馬上跑去李洛的營房幫忙

615
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,458
‎那體貼的孩子把日記寄給我

616
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:04,375
‎原來如此

617
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:08,750
‎而且方才，他一看見我

618
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:14,583
‎就說：“妳應該帶李洛的日記
‎回肯塔基

619
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:17,958
‎想把它燒掉的話，儘管去做吧”

620
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,583
‎真貼心

621
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,291
‎但我都看不懂

622
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,750
‎上面寫滿了數字和字母

623
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:30,875
‎不過…看到軍方讓你帶領調查

624
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,625
‎我覺得這應該交給你才對

625
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:09,041
‎我會時常回來見你

626
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,875
‎-幫忙照料她…
‎-我明白

627
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:12,875
‎…我們同舟共濟

628
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,083
‎醫生

629
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,541
‎蘭道先生，遇到你真巧

630
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:23,875
‎容我介紹內人茱莉亞

631
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,625
‎久仰大名

632
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:29,125
‎幸會

633
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:32,958
‎你不是調查弗萊先生之死的人嗎？

634
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:34,666
‎是的

635
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,833
‎我們才剛聊到這件事

636
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:43,666
‎我先生說即使他的英勇嘗試

637
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:49,625
‎弗萊先生的遺體狀態不佳
‎無法瞻仰遺容

638
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,208
‎他的父母真可憐

639
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:55,708
‎的確

640
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,916
‎這整件事令我們震驚不已

641
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:03,916
‎放心，我一定會逮到凶手的

642
00:53:08,708 --> 00:53:10,708
‎很高興認識妳

643
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:12,500
‎親愛的

644
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:15,833
‎蘭道先生，聽說你是鰥夫

645
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:18,916
‎沒錯

646
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,708
‎我深表同情

647
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:25,833
‎夫人蒙主恩召是最近的事嗎？

648
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,541
‎已過了兩年

649
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:33,041
‎才搬來高地幾個月後就過世了

650
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,916
‎突然病逝嗎？

651
00:53:38,458 --> 00:53:39,291
‎並非突然

652
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:41,666
‎可惜拖太久了

653
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,375
‎我與你一同哀悼

654
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:50,000
‎-請節哀
‎-謝謝

655
00:54:27,416 --> 00:54:28,333
‎太棒了

656
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:32,166
‎埃德加，就說我妹妹是才女吧？

657
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,500
‎親愛的，太棒了，我感動到落淚

658
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:36,458
‎是啊

659
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:39,125
‎馬奎斯小姐，彈得真好

660
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:40,666
‎-千真萬確
‎-是的

661
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:43,375
‎妳註定會萬古不朽

662
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,958
‎藍迪，不會有女人想要長生不死的

663
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:50,375
‎我頓時想起托馬斯格雷的一首詩

664
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,750
‎“花開無人賞”

665
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:56,583
‎“芳香也成荒”

666
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,041
‎這是我最愛的一首詩

667
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:05,250
‎那妳覺得我的小門徒如何？

668
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:08,791
‎我認為坡先生當門徒是大材小用

669
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:12,000
‎他跟你們在一起，卻出淤泥而不染

670
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:15,833
‎好了，麗雅

671
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:19,250
‎夠了，吃晚飯前休息一下

672
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,875
‎-各位，失陪了
‎-謝謝，麗雅

673
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:25,875
‎藍迪，椅子拿來

674
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:28,208
‎斯達德，快點，準備棋盤

675
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,208
‎好，我好無聊

676
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,375
‎那又怎樣

677
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:33,541
‎她生病了

678
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,125
‎不該讓她抱病宴客…

679
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:37,708
‎馬奎斯小姐

680
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:40,750
‎不好意思

681
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:49,916
‎這將是莫大榮幸
‎若我能邀妳週六與我一同出去

682
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:56,291
‎我相信你，坡先生
‎但我恐怕週六有約了

683
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,208
‎這樣啊

684
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:24,083
‎所以你想要週六碰面？

685
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,041
‎週日也行，只要合妳的意

686
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:30,916
‎週一也無妨

687
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,250
‎你想在哪裡碰面？

688
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:35,916
‎讓我猜，吉斯角？情人步道？

689
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
‎不是

690
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:38,875
‎都不是

691
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:41,458
‎我在想墓園

692
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:43,500
‎墓園？

693
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,333
‎真有意思

694
00:56:47,416 --> 00:56:48,750
‎是的，我也這麼認為

695
00:56:51,666 --> 00:56:53,541
‎那麼，晚安

696
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,708
‎真是一片荒涼

697
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:57,750
‎要欣賞高地的美景

698
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:01,541
‎葉落之時是最佳時機

699
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:03,416
‎為何？

700
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:06,083
‎草木沒有錦上添花的作用

701
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:09,541
‎反而只會阻礙上帝原來的設計

702
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,458
‎真浪漫

703
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:16,000
‎你真是滿嘴不離上帝和死亡

704
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:20,291
‎死亡的確是詩人最鍾愛的主題

705
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:29,208
‎請坐

706
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,041
‎-真宜人
‎-的確，我最喜歡的地方

707
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:44,333
‎陰沉很適合你

708
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,875
‎比你穿的制服還要搭

709
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:52,666
‎全世界只有亞提莫斯跟你有得比

710
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:57,333
‎我從未見過他憂鬱的一面

711
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:02,041
‎他幾乎都活在自己的世界裡

712
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:16,541
‎長期沉浸在痛苦之中

713
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:18,250
‎並非不可能

714
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,125
‎但無法永遠持續下去

715
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:27,583
‎你們倆有許多共同點

716
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:37,166
‎希望妳不會冷

717
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:42,458
‎顯然寒冬已降臨

718
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:43,541
‎拜託別說了

719
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:47,166
‎我不是來這裡聊天氣的，真無趣

720
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,666
‎抱歉，我只是擔心妳會著涼

721
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,000
‎那請繼續吧

722
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:55,750
‎對我宣揚你至死不渝的愛
‎我們就可以好好回家了

723
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:58,458
‎-我只是在說…
‎-對不起

724
00:59:59,708 --> 01:00:02,166
‎抱歉，我真無禮，不曉得為什麼

725
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:06,333
‎妳確實冷了

726
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,791
‎馬奎斯小姐，要不要穿我的斗篷？

727
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:11,750
‎-不必了
‎-真的沒關係…

728
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:12,666
‎我…

729
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:16,000
‎-什麼？
‎-馬奎斯小姐

730
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:18,541
‎麗雅

731
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:25,541
‎麗雅…怎麼回事？

732
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:26,458
‎麗雅

733
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,666
‎麗雅

734
01:00:37,916 --> 01:00:39,083
‎天啊，麗雅

735
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:41,833
‎妳還好嗎？

736
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:46,083
‎-麗雅
‎-我很好

737
01:00:56,666 --> 01:01:00,458
‎妳確定妳沒事嗎？我嚇壞了

738
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:03,625
‎這很常發生，不必擔心

739
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,125
‎妳的…

740
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,916
‎我與妳意氣相投，所以我想和妳分享

741
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:19,458
‎我母親仍存在我的生命中

742
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:23,583
‎在夢中和清醒時皆然

743
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,833
‎是的

744
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:31,083
‎有時候，我認為亡者糾纏我們
‎是因為我們愛他們愛得不夠深

745
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:36,250
‎我們遺忘了他們
‎雖然不是故意的，但還是遺忘了

746
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:42,833
‎他們是因為被遺棄了才會糾纏不放

747
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:47,083
‎還是別想太多好了

748
01:01:58,291 --> 01:02:00,208
‎我想讓你知道，我很感謝你

749
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:04,625
‎當我張開眼睛看見你

750
01:02:05,916 --> 01:02:07,291
‎我注視著你的雙眼

751
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,583
‎發現了前所未有的東西

752
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:13,666
‎千年難得一見

753
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:16,666
‎謝謝

754
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,500
‎住手

755
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:26,041
‎混帳，給我安分點

756
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,083
‎離麗雅遠一點

757
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:34,708
‎住手

758
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:39,500
‎貝林傑，住手

759
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,833
‎否則給我準備上法庭

760
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:56,500
‎醜八怪

761
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:02,166
‎你沒事吧？

762
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:06,000
‎那野人顯然知道麗雅比較喜歡我

763
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:08,416
‎-若他想把我嚇跑…
‎-嚇跑？

764
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,125
‎-他一副要殺了你的樣子
‎-殺了我？

765
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,291
‎我才不會讓他阻撓我追求心之所向

766
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:18,041
‎我才會殺了他

767
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:24,083
‎大家老是低估我

768
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:27,250
‎朋友、同學，甚至是我的施主

769
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:28,750
‎-派希，謝謝
‎-所有人都是

770
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:30,416
‎所有人…

771
01:04:33,625 --> 01:04:34,625
‎除了我的慈母

772
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:40,333
‎感謝你剛才挺身相助

773
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:43,250
‎很少有人能讓我出其不意

774
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:47,333
‎你也讓人出其不意，不是嗎？蘭道

775
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:50,750
‎無意冒犯

776
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:54,750
‎但你比外表看起來還要老成持重

777
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,708
‎告訴我，你是否真的曾經
‎只靠一個犀利眼神

778
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:02,250
‎就讓凶手招供？

779
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,333
‎只要有足夠的耐心

780
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,291
‎不必開口，嫌犯就會訊問自己

781
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,583
‎蘭道，有你的陪伴真好

782
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,666
‎我有一天會寫一首詩

783
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:33,208
‎讓你名留青史

784
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:55,250
‎經過這場攻擊事件
‎你仍不把藍迪貝林傑當嫌犯？

785
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,125
‎那這對你的調查來說

786
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:01,375
‎會有什麼影響？

787
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,458
‎我想把焦點放在亞提莫斯馬奎斯身上

788
01:06:06,875 --> 01:06:08,041
‎看來妳認識他？

789
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:11,708
‎誰不認識？

790
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:15,416
‎多麼英俊瀟灑

791
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:20,208
‎這種人感覺註定要英年早逝

792
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:26,250
‎但他看起來不像會使用暴力的人

793
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,541
‎總是非常沉著冷靜

794
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:33,416
‎或許凶手不是他

795
01:06:35,333 --> 01:06:39,208
‎他散發一種特質，全家人都是

796
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:42,125
‎一副犯了什麼罪的樣子

797
01:06:45,875 --> 01:06:48,291
‎有哪個家庭沒有犯過罪的？

798
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:58,166
‎-上尉
‎-是貝林傑先生

799
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:01,416
‎他失蹤了

800
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:43,666
‎上尉，這裡

801
01:07:55,833 --> 01:07:56,833
‎老天爺

802
01:08:19,541 --> 01:08:25,833
‎貝林傑先生的傷口切緣
‎不像弗萊的乾淨俐落

803
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,708
‎凶手應該不是同一個人

804
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,583
‎至於被閹割的事…

805
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,208
‎這…

806
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:39,875
‎閹割？

807
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:42,208
‎天啊，蘭道

808
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,833
‎我們毫無進展

809
01:08:45,916 --> 01:08:47,291
‎跟一個月前沒兩樣

810
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:48,875
‎有進展了

811
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:51,208
‎-遲早會水落石出的
‎-告訴我

812
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:55,583
‎你有沒有找到更多撒旦儀式的證據？

813
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:00,541
‎或是那個叫考科藍二等兵

814
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:02,291
‎拋下李洛弗萊屍體的軍官？

815
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:04,625
‎還有弗萊的日記

816
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:07,833
‎你有沒有找到任何一條可用的線索？

817
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:13,875
‎有個瘋子逍遙法外
‎把我學員的心臟挖出

818
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:18,416
‎我的學員紛紛不敢值勤
‎不敢出營房也不敢睡覺

819
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:21,250
‎敢睡覺的，也都是抱著槍入睡

820
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,666
‎我開始認為你不覺得我有能力

821
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,916
‎繼續進行調查

822
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:34,166
‎謝謝，醫生

823
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:45,208
‎我們質疑的不是你的能力
‎而是你的忠誠

824
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:50,166
‎這有沒有可能是出自坡先生之手？

825
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:52,041
‎坡？

826
01:09:52,125 --> 01:09:54,791
‎他昨日還跟同學得意洋洋地分享

827
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:58,500
‎他和貝林傑先生的精彩打鬥

828
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:02,083
‎還揚言他們下次起爭執

829
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,500
‎他就要殺了他

830
01:10:04,583 --> 01:10:06,208
‎你見過坡吧

831
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:11,291
‎你真心覺得他有辦法制伏貝林傑？

832
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:15,083
‎不，但他不必靠蠻力
‎用槍就能輕鬆解決

833
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:17,583
‎無論他和貝林傑是敵是友

834
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:21,958
‎坡和李洛弗萊並沒有任何關聯

835
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:24,458
‎-他們甚至素不相識
‎-他們彼此相識

836
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,791
‎去年夏天還打了一場架

837
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:34,166
‎看來他沒有告訴你吧？

838
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,125
‎那就逮捕他吧

839
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:43,958
‎既然你這麼篤定是他，就逮捕他吧

840
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:45,958
‎我們只有動機

841
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:49,166
‎該提供證據的人是你

842
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:54,958
‎蘭道先生，你是否對敝校懷有不滿？

843
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:56,541
‎是這個原因嗎？

844
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:05,208
‎我正在冒生命危險
‎為你們寶貴的機構展開調查

845
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:09,250
‎不過是的

846
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:16,875
‎我一向認為軍校
‎只會剝奪青年的自由意志

847
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:21,125
‎以規範和規定侷限他們

848
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:27,291
‎讓他們喪失理性判斷、失去人性

849
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:32,125
‎你是在說
‎軍校必須為這些死亡負責嗎？

850
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:36,500
‎是的，對方跟軍校有關聯
‎所以軍校本身也有問題

851
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,000
‎胡說八道

852
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:39,291
‎照你的邏輯來說

853
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:44,000
‎基督徒所犯下的罪行
‎都會牽連到耶穌基督

854
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,541
‎沒錯

855
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:07,583
‎我請你接下這份工作時

856
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:16,166
‎你說你跟李洛弗萊毫無瓜葛，所以…

857
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,333
‎就先從這裡開始吧，如何？

858
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:26,541
‎-這不全然是事實…
‎-哎呀

859
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:29,166
‎為什麼只要跟你有關的事
‎都要搞得這麼複雜？

860
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,666
‎事實在哪裡？我只要單純的事實

861
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,166
‎是或否

862
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,625
‎告訴我真相

863
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:42,166
‎你是否認識李洛弗萊？

864
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,083
‎是

865
01:12:43,958 --> 01:12:47,166
‎你有沒有和李洛弗萊說過話？

866
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,083
‎有的

867
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:57,291
‎你有沒有殺死李洛弗萊？

868
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:02,916
‎你有沒有殺死藍道夫貝林傑？

869
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:15,375
‎你有沒有褻瀆他們的屍體？

870
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:18,916
‎-沒有，我拿自己的性命發誓…
‎-但你不否認

871
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,875
‎你曾威脅過這兩名死者？

872
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:25,666
‎我之前威脅貝林傑…

873
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,833
‎都只是氣話

874
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:35,750
‎-那弗萊呢？
‎-我從來沒有威脅過他，我只是…

875
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:41,000
‎坡，我觀察出相當令人不安的規律

876
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:46,791
‎惹到你的人最後都命喪黃泉

877
01:13:46,875 --> 01:13:51,958
‎而且重要器官都被挖出來了

878
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:54,041
‎蘭道先生

879
01:13:58,208 --> 01:13:59,958
‎我來這裡不久，但如果我要殺死

880
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:02,958
‎每一個霸凌我的學員

881
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:08,041
‎那這裡的學員軍團成員

882
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,791
‎恐怕只會剩下個位數

883
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:17,250
‎若你非要知道，我來這裡第一天開始

884
01:14:18,208 --> 01:14:19,833
‎就是大家嘲弄的對象

885
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:26,375
‎我的行為舉止、年齡和性格…

886
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:30,291
‎以及我的外觀

887
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:36,666
‎哪怕我能活千百輩子

888
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:39,166
‎也無法治癒

889
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:40,583
‎我這一生所受過的傷

890
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:48,250
‎是的，我犯下許多過錯
‎但那可絕對沒有

891
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:52,208
‎我絕對沒有殺過人

892
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,875
‎你現在相信我了嗎？

893
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:06,166
‎你應該多注意自己的言行

894
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:14,416
‎我可以暫時阻止希區考克鎖定你

895
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:21,833
‎但你再欺騙我的話

896
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:27,250
‎他們把你抓去關我也不會幫你

897
01:15:27,333 --> 01:15:30,458
‎明白嗎？

898
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,333
‎失陪了，我晚餐有約

899
01:16:08,958 --> 01:16:15,916
‎感謝你與我們一同哀悼
‎藍道夫的不幸逝世

900
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:19,541
‎那孩子就像我們的家人

901
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:28,875
‎蘭道先生
‎你不覺得小犬非常英俊嗎？

902
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:41,083
‎令嬡和令郎都外貌出眾

903
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:44,583
‎是的，我們有優越的基因

904
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:50,000
‎但我不得不說，你是難得一見的人才

905
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:54,458
‎絕頂聰明

906
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,291
‎這是我們這裡極為少見的特質

907
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,666
‎蘭道先生，憑你的才智

908
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:07,166
‎我希望在你的正式工作結束之後

909
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:10,541
‎能為我解開一個謎團

910
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:13,916
‎-謎團？
‎-令人百思不解的怪事

911
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,958
‎週一的獨奏會

912
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:20,416
‎有人亂翻我的物品

913
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:22,375
‎那…

914
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:27,125
‎-壞人到處都是
‎-父親，當真嗎？

915
01:17:27,625 --> 01:17:30,958
‎我倒是認為那傢伙只是很無禮

916
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:33,208
‎雖然我不知道對方是誰

917
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:39,041
‎但你還是得小心，亞提莫斯

918
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:41,791
‎-真的要小心
‎-母親

919
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:45,625
‎對方八成只是個無聊的老頭子

920
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:50,250
‎閒閒沒事做，毫無生活可言

921
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:54,125
‎某個住在農舍的村民

922
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,416
‎蘭道先生，你不覺得嗎？

923
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:02,125
‎-你不是住在農舍嗎？
‎-亞提莫斯

924
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:06,208
‎你搞不好認識我說的那種人

925
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:09,541
‎說不定你剛好有個
‎喜歡在酒館喝酒的朋友

926
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:13,083
‎夠了，拜託，我厭惡這種行為

927
01:18:13,625 --> 01:18:16,000
‎我最討厭你這樣無端生事

928
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,750
‎-母親，我不明白妳的意思
‎-當然了

929
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:21,875
‎我平常說什麼話也沒人在乎

930
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,583
‎沒有人會在乎

931
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:26,208
‎-丹尼爾，你說是不是？
‎-兒子，別這樣

932
01:18:36,416 --> 01:18:40,416
‎請原諒內人

933
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:45,250
‎貝林傑先生之死

934
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:50,291
‎讓我們家被哀愁籠罩

935
01:18:58,041 --> 01:19:02,458
‎蘭道先生，不曉得你願不願意
‎去書房跟我談談？

936
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:03,541
‎樂意之至

937
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:14,250
‎抱歉，警官

938
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:20,791
‎天天過著如坐針氈的生活
‎讓我們難以承受

939
01:19:21,541 --> 01:19:23,041
‎-不必道歉
‎-是

940
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:28,375
‎逢這時節，又不得自由活動…

941
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:31,791
‎我完全能理解

942
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:39,541
‎醫生，我注意到

943
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:44,208
‎令嬡是不是身體有恙？

944
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:47,208
‎觀察真敏銳

945
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:49,458
‎是的

946
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:52,708
‎是的，她…

947
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,791
‎她一路走來很辛苦

948
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,541
‎從小就這樣了

949
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:06,583
‎她罹患重病
‎讓她在四下無人時癲癇發作

950
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:11,750
‎大腦停止運作，身體像葫蘆一樣搖動

951
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,291
‎多麼美麗的孩子

952
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:20,125
‎註定要結婚生子，成為達官貴人

953
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25,583
‎卻同時又身患重病

954
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,125
‎相當不幸

955
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:37,000
‎兩位，麗雅在彈琴，請你們一同欣賞

956
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,208
‎謝謝，兒子

957
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:43,541
‎走吧？

958
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:48,250
‎不介意的話，我想出去透透氣

959
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:49,291
‎沒問題

960
01:20:55,291 --> 01:20:58,291
‎父親，一起玩個遊戲

961
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,375
‎跟上次一樣嗎？
‎還是換個更有挑戰性的遊戲？

962
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:08,166
‎-太出色了
‎-才不

963
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:10,208
‎還可以吧

964
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:14,416
‎妳不知曉妳彈的曲子對我有何影響

965
01:23:16,166 --> 01:23:18,166
‎對大家都是，真的，我…

966
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:23,208
‎-什麼？
‎-我…

967
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:33,333
‎我不知道該如何啟齒，但我發現

968
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,708
‎我願為妳做任何事情

969
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:45,958
‎埃德加

970
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:13,583
‎蘭道先生，需要幫你找什麼東西嗎？

971
01:24:14,958 --> 01:24:17,291
‎妳這麼快就恢復了

972
01:24:17,916 --> 01:24:19,375
‎不好意思

973
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:23,750
‎我以為我偏頭痛又發作了

974
01:24:23,833 --> 01:24:28,333
‎沒想到休息一下就沒事了

975
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:30,708
‎而且現在神清氣爽

976
01:24:34,791 --> 01:24:37,750
‎把這老舊的東西放回去吧

977
01:24:37,833 --> 01:24:39,875
‎肯定不合身

978
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:44,625
‎我和醫生一直在找它

979
01:24:45,166 --> 01:24:46,625
‎結果找到了

980
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:52,083
‎親愛的，你看警官在衣櫃裡找到什麼

981
01:24:52,666 --> 01:24:58,083
‎記得亞提莫斯小時候
‎在家裡都會穿在身上嗎？

982
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:01,333
‎-記得嗎？親愛的
‎-記得，母親

983
01:25:01,416 --> 01:25:03,666
‎-那是我兄弟的外套
‎-你兄弟？

984
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:06,500
‎那是他唯一遺留下來的物品

985
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:08,791
‎怎麼會在你手上？

986
01:25:08,875 --> 01:25:10,500
‎也許亞提莫斯能回答

987
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:22,541
‎伊森

988
01:25:24,916 --> 01:25:26,166
‎什麼風把你吹來的？

989
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:28,875
‎又有學員失蹤了

990
01:25:31,875 --> 01:25:35,250
‎我已組織搜救團隊
‎會在一小時內出發

991
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:37,458
‎我們要翻遍每一寸土地

992
01:25:37,541 --> 01:25:39,583
‎上帝保佑，我不敢想像這次…

993
01:25:39,666 --> 01:25:40,500
‎各位

994
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:43,375
‎我剛去斯達德先生的營房

995
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:48,166
‎他的行李箱是空的
‎裡面沒有任何便衣

996
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,375
‎我認為他逃跑了

997
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:52,500
‎逃跑了？

998
01:25:52,583 --> 01:25:54,750
‎弗萊的日記顯示

999
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:58,791
‎斯達德和貝林傑
‎都和李洛弗萊是好朋友

1000
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,958
‎他一定怕自己是下一個受害者
‎所以逃跑了

1001
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:04,708
‎儘管如此，那亞提莫斯
‎怎麼會有軍官的外套？

1002
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:08,250
‎若他有涉案
‎我們怎麼能不馬上逮捕他？

1003
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:13,208
‎他太過冷靜沉著，一定會堅決否認

1004
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:17,291
‎我想試試最後一個辦法

1005
01:26:17,791 --> 01:26:19,750
‎他身邊最親密的好友都死了

1006
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:23,083
‎我必須立刻向總統報告
‎凶手已逮捕到案

1007
01:26:24,791 --> 01:26:27,291
‎蘭道，我們已逮到凶手了，不是嗎？

1008
01:26:47,666 --> 01:26:48,666
‎埃德加

1009
01:26:54,541 --> 01:26:55,458
‎教授？

1010
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
‎佩裴

1011
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:05,875
‎上次來此，你提到獵巫者和一本書

1012
01:27:05,958 --> 01:27:08,791
‎是的，《魔鬼話語》

1013
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:10,791
‎亨利勒克

1014
01:27:11,333 --> 01:27:13,166
‎勒克是牧師嗎？

1015
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:15,416
‎被燒死的牧師

1016
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:21,208
‎我在睡夢中得到靈感

1017
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:25,791
‎狂野疾風

1018
01:27:26,791 --> 01:27:30,000
‎奔馳而下

1019
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:34,791
‎我悲痛地懇求她快一點

1020
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:37,958
‎“麗諾”

1021
01:27:40,166 --> 01:27:42,375
‎她不願回答

1022
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:46,416
‎無盡的夜晚籠罩著她

1023
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,666
‎僅露出她的淡藍之眸

1024
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,416
‎黯然之夜

1025
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:53,458
‎怒火燃燒

1026
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:56,708
‎僅剩下

1027
01:27:58,041 --> 01:27:59,500
‎那雙致命淡藍之眸

1028
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:07,541
‎發現其中的關聯了嗎？

1029
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:11,291
‎麗諾

1030
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:13,833
‎麗雅

1031
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:18,625
‎這是妳深埋在心中的痛苦

1032
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:24,166
‎反映出妳一直以來的壓抑

1033
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:25,666
‎這首詩

1034
01:28:28,958 --> 01:28:30,541
‎在對我們說話

1035
01:28:41,375 --> 01:28:44,500
‎還記得你說你願為我做任何事情嗎？

1036
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:48,791
‎魔鬼的崇拜者

1037
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:56,250
‎-謝謝，佩裴
‎-不會

1038
01:29:09,541 --> 01:29:10,583
‎蘭道先生

1039
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,583
‎你們一家人

1040
01:29:16,791 --> 01:29:20,333
‎你們一家人

1041
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:22,833
‎是一團謎

1042
01:29:24,041 --> 01:29:29,041
‎我一直摸不透誰是一家之主

1043
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:32,625
‎我曾經懷疑過你們每一個人

1044
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:34,750
‎但我萬萬沒想到

1045
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:40,250
‎幕後主使會是一個亡魂

1046
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:42,958
‎什麼意思？

1047
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:46,875
‎亨利勒克牧師

1048
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:51,500
‎獵巫者中的佼佼者

1049
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:55,083
‎直到他最後也成了獵物

1050
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:58,250
‎你在說什麼？

1051
01:29:59,166 --> 01:30:04,250
‎令嬡患有癲癇症，不是嗎？

1052
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:08,291
‎她能勉強度日是因為她跟某人有接觸

1053
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,791
‎一個在暗中指導她的人

1054
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:14,041
‎就是他

1055
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:19,375
‎蘭道先生，我開始懷疑你瘋了

1056
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:21,666
‎你在暗示什麼？

1057
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:33,833
‎勒克的《魔鬼話語》

1058
01:30:37,916 --> 01:30:42,500
‎與魔鬼溝通

1059
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:47,083
‎不是我熟悉的嗜好，蘭道先生

1060
01:30:47,625 --> 01:30:50,958
‎我從未讀過他的書

1061
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:55,541
‎令嬡會不會與亡者溝通？

1062
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:16,000
‎她的癲癇年復一年每況愈下

1063
01:31:17,583 --> 01:31:18,416
‎我…

1064
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:25,083
‎各種療法我都試過了

1065
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:28,708
‎醫生宣告她只剩三個月可活

1066
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:32,125
‎你知道那是什麼感覺嗎？

1067
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:35,166
‎入睡時不知道自己女兒
‎能否熬到明日？

1068
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:39,625
‎但有一天，她跟我說

1069
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:44,583
‎她遇見了一個人

1070
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,875
‎她的曾曾祖父

1071
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:48,416
‎勒克？

1072
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:51,041
‎亨利勒克非邪惡之人

1073
01:31:53,291 --> 01:31:55,416
‎他只是被誤解了

1074
01:32:48,583 --> 01:32:52,916
‎他們發誓弗萊已經死了

1075
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,083
‎他們發誓他們不可能殺死任何人

1076
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:57,125
‎你竟然相信他們

1077
01:32:57,208 --> 01:32:58,791
‎我別無選擇

1078
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:01,791
‎你是醫生，科學之人

1079
01:33:01,875 --> 01:33:05,125
‎怎能輕信這種謬論？

1080
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,041
‎因為…

1081
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:11,000
‎因為我救不了她

1082
01:33:11,750 --> 01:33:14,208
‎我自己的專長辜負了我

1083
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:19,541
‎我為了麗雅犧牲一切

1084
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:23,250
‎怎能拒絕另一個解救她的可能？

1085
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:24,291
‎醫生

1086
01:33:25,916 --> 01:33:27,708
‎和亡者溝通

1087
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:32,333
‎非正常之舉，但殺人…

1088
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,333
‎殘殺無辜性命

1089
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,750
‎太沒人性了

1090
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,375
‎有人必須為此負責

1091
01:33:48,541 --> 01:33:54,083
‎我讓她這麼做只因為…奇蹟似地

1092
01:33:55,333 --> 01:33:57,041
‎她的症狀似乎有所改善

1093
01:33:58,250 --> 01:34:00,666
‎醫生，你家人在哪裡？

1094
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:03,875
‎你的孩子在哪？

1095
01:34:05,083 --> 01:34:07,333
‎坡先生剛才在這裡

1096
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:12,291
‎他跟…亞提莫斯一起走了

1097
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:15,875
‎他的外套怎麼還在大廳裡？

1098
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:18,791
‎醫生，麗雅在哪裡？

1099
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:22,625
‎醫生，你的家人在哪裡？

1100
01:34:29,916 --> 01:34:31,708
‎作用開始消退了

1101
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,458
‎麗雅

1102
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:38,041
‎繼續

1103
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:06,458
‎這是怎麼回事？

1104
01:35:09,583 --> 01:35:11,000
‎再忍耐一下就結束了

1105
01:35:11,083 --> 01:35:14,208
‎我好不舒服

1106
01:35:16,875 --> 01:35:19,083
‎-我以為…
‎-不

1107
01:35:22,083 --> 01:35:25,583
‎再過幾分鐘，我就自由了

1108
01:35:29,375 --> 01:35:30,541
‎自由？

1109
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:31,625
‎是的

1110
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:35,500
‎拜託，麗雅，我…

1111
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:39,041
‎我必須這麼做

1112
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:41,916
‎你明白吧

1113
01:35:42,833 --> 01:35:46,375
‎犧牲是愛的終極表現

1114
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:51,833
‎我第一眼看見你就知道
‎你是我的命中註定

1115
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:54,791
‎麗雅

1116
01:35:55,333 --> 01:35:57,791
‎-什麼事？
‎-我真心愛妳

1117
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:31,791
‎夠了

1118
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,500
‎-出去！
‎-你們會被吊死的

1119
01:36:39,583 --> 01:36:40,708
‎你沒理由來這裡

1120
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:41,708
‎麗雅，快下手

1121
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:44,750
‎馬奎斯夫人
‎妳想看到自己的子女被吊死嗎？

1122
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:47,208
‎-別聽他亂講
‎-繼續

1123
01:36:47,291 --> 01:36:49,750
‎-麗雅
‎-那是弗萊的心臟，不是嗎？

1124
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:51,708
‎-蘭道
‎-麗雅，繼續

1125
01:36:51,791 --> 01:36:54,791
‎貝林傑，他願為妳上山下海
‎連殺人也願意

1126
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:56,333
‎而亞提莫斯，你殺了他

1127
01:36:56,416 --> 01:36:58,666
‎請你離開，快結束了

1128
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,958
‎-麗雅，快下手
‎-麗雅，早就結束了

1129
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:02,791
‎原來是妳

1130
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:06,375
‎是妳寫字條引誘弗萊去…

1131
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:08,083
‎不是她的主意，是我的

1132
01:37:08,166 --> 01:37:09,791
‎-是我做的
‎-不，亞提莫斯

1133
01:37:09,875 --> 01:37:12,791
‎-不
‎-拜託，住手

1134
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:17,708
‎住手

1135
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:20,333
‎麗雅

1136
01:37:46,041 --> 01:37:47,041
‎麗雅

1137
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:49,625
‎-麗雅
‎-麗雅

1138
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:53,333
‎亞提莫斯

1139
01:37:59,875 --> 01:38:01,125
‎母親，別過來

1140
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:02,208
‎亞提莫斯

1141
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:04,041
‎麗雅

1142
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:17,208
‎亞提莫斯，不

1143
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:24,166
‎放開我，不

1144
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:27,291
‎亞提莫斯

1145
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:43,458
‎亞提莫斯，不

1146
01:38:44,875 --> 01:38:47,458
‎麗雅

1147
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:49,375
‎不

1148
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,291
‎醫生說他只有輕微失血

1149
01:39:43,375 --> 01:39:45,125
‎傷勢不嚴重

1150
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:48,250
‎這或許是最好的結果了

1151
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:55,250
‎不得不承認，真是人不可貌相

1152
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:56,458
‎一點也沒錯

1153
01:39:58,083 --> 01:40:01,000
‎我們該拿馬奎斯夫人怎麼辦？

1154
01:40:02,083 --> 01:40:04,625
‎就讓她這個母親好好哀悼吧

1155
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:08,041
‎法官認為她已吃了不少苦

1156
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,500
‎值得你高興的是

1157
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:15,333
‎我們的醫生已遞了辭呈

1158
01:40:16,958 --> 01:40:21,541
‎我跟你保證，我一點都不高興

1159
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:25,791
‎蘭道

1160
01:40:33,208 --> 01:40:38,375
‎你我的性格和理念可說是南轅北轍

1161
01:40:41,458 --> 01:40:43,208
‎但我想表達的是

1162
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:46,416
‎若我在這整件事情中得到任何領悟

1163
01:40:49,375 --> 01:40:54,750
‎那就是…若我在過程中曾經質疑過…

1164
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,375
‎你的能力

1165
01:41:00,916 --> 01:41:02,000
‎我誠心向你致歉

1166
01:41:05,166 --> 01:41:06,208
‎謝謝，上尉

1167
01:41:17,333 --> 01:41:21,125
‎我怎能與這些人交涉這麼多年？

1168
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:24,625
‎我把他們當作一家人

1169
01:41:24,708 --> 01:41:27,125
‎殊不知他們有這麼大的痛苦

1170
01:41:28,125 --> 01:41:29,791
‎上校，是他們刻意隱瞞的

1171
01:41:34,916 --> 01:41:36,833
‎是我失職了，居然沒發現

1172
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:42,500
‎我猜亞提莫斯殺了貝林傑先生

1173
01:41:42,583 --> 01:41:44,875
‎是為了防止他通報警方

1174
01:41:44,958 --> 01:41:48,916
‎而斯達德先生因不想遇害而逃跑了

1175
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:51,125
‎這麼想沒錯

1176
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,666
‎蘭道

1177
01:41:57,416 --> 01:42:01,041
‎你已完成了你的職務

1178
01:42:01,875 --> 01:42:04,083
‎我在此解除你的合約

1179
01:42:05,666 --> 01:42:07,375
‎希望你對此結果很滿意

1180
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:11,250
‎至少希望你能接受我們的謝意

1181
01:42:14,666 --> 01:42:20,375
‎希望華府的參議員
‎會打消關閉軍校的念頭

1182
01:42:21,125 --> 01:42:24,125
‎我們應該還能死前掙扎一段時間

1183
01:42:24,791 --> 01:42:26,750
‎是的，上校

1184
01:42:59,916 --> 01:43:01,833
‎你看起來恢復得完好如初

1185
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:11,458
‎我知道令嬡的事

1186
01:43:16,291 --> 01:43:17,250
‎好吧

1187
01:43:18,916 --> 01:43:21,500
‎小瑪跟這件事有何關係？

1188
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:22,541
‎關係可大了

1189
01:43:23,875 --> 01:43:25,333
‎你也知道

1190
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,000
‎我是在睡夢中頓悟的

1191
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:20,750
‎李洛弗萊手中的字條

1192
01:44:21,375 --> 01:44:25,166
‎把那可憐的傢伙引出營房的字條

1193
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:29,541
‎你把它交給我，著實大意了

1194
01:44:38,791 --> 01:44:41,041
‎這是你留給我的字條

1195
01:44:43,666 --> 01:44:44,791
‎記得嗎？

1196
01:44:49,166 --> 01:44:50,166
‎你的字跡

1197
01:44:51,541 --> 01:44:53,750
‎令我大吃一驚

1198
01:44:54,708 --> 01:44:58,125
‎大寫和小寫一樣能讓人露出馬腳

1199
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:01,125
‎你寫的字母A、R、G和E

1200
01:45:01,208 --> 01:45:05,708
‎跟李洛弗萊手中的字條如出一轍

1201
01:45:07,416 --> 01:45:11,625
‎可想而知，我震驚不已

1202
01:45:13,833 --> 01:45:17,416
‎這兩張字條可能出自
‎同一個人之手嗎？

1203
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:23,791
‎而且蘭道為何要聯繫李洛弗萊？

1204
01:45:26,416 --> 01:45:30,875
‎所幸，我遇到了美妙的派希

1205
01:45:36,125 --> 01:45:37,833
‎她把緣由都告訴我了

1206
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:41,833
‎她從軍校舞會返家的路上…

1207
01:45:42,416 --> 01:45:43,500
‎抓住她

1208
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:45,458
‎-壓住她
‎-不要

1209
01:45:45,541 --> 01:45:47,041
‎你的小瑪遭強暴…

1210
01:45:47,833 --> 01:45:48,833
‎不要！

1211
01:45:48,916 --> 01:45:51,500
‎…被三名惡棍丟在路上，命若懸絲

1212
01:45:51,583 --> 01:45:52,500
‎別出聲

1213
01:45:54,833 --> 01:45:55,958
‎朱利斯，抓住她的腿

1214
01:45:56,041 --> 01:45:58,416
‎-不要
‎-抓住她

1215
01:45:59,583 --> 01:46:01,708
‎-張開她的腿，壓住她
‎-不

1216
01:46:01,791 --> 01:46:03,000
‎-求求你
‎-別讓她亂動

1217
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:05,333
‎果然是壞朋友

1218
01:46:06,791 --> 01:46:08,375
‎正如李洛弗萊所說

1219
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:11,250
‎小瑪？

1220
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:14,333
‎天啊，小瑪

1221
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:16,500
‎天啊，過來

1222
01:46:20,666 --> 01:46:21,833
‎小瑪

1223
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:24,916
‎對不起

1224
01:46:27,458 --> 01:46:29,041
‎-對不起
‎-沒關係

1225
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:32,625
‎不會有事的

1226
01:46:35,125 --> 01:46:36,125
‎事情會好轉的

1227
01:47:11,708 --> 01:47:13,916
‎小瑪，他幫不了妳

1228
01:47:15,625 --> 01:47:18,041
‎親愛的，拜託，讓我幫妳

1229
01:47:25,083 --> 01:47:29,083
‎但她沒有離家，對吧？

1230
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:44,291
‎小瑪？

1231
01:47:49,708 --> 01:47:50,541
‎小瑪

1232
01:47:57,541 --> 01:47:58,541
‎小瑪

1233
01:48:06,833 --> 01:48:09,416
‎小瑪，拜託，過來

1234
01:48:13,250 --> 01:48:16,250
‎親愛的，求求妳，過來，拜託

1235
01:48:16,916 --> 01:48:18,041
‎不要

1236
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:19,791
‎不會有事的

1237
01:48:21,583 --> 01:48:23,375
‎拜託，小瑪，回來

1238
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:25,916
‎事情會好轉的

1239
01:48:29,375 --> 01:48:30,208
‎不要

1240
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:32,541
‎我愛你

1241
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:56,458
‎你為何從沒告訴我？

1242
01:48:58,250 --> 01:48:59,375
‎這不是

1243
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:02,291
‎我喜歡分享的故事

1244
01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:07,666
‎但我原本可以寬慰你

1245
01:49:09,666 --> 01:49:12,916
‎幫助你，正如你幫助我一樣

1246
01:49:17,875 --> 01:49:22,958
‎這件事恐怕沒人能為我帶來寬慰

1247
01:49:29,416 --> 01:49:32,375
‎於是我做了什麼？

1248
01:49:34,125 --> 01:49:37,291
‎跟你會做的一樣

1249
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:40,541
‎檢視所有推論

1250
01:49:41,458 --> 01:49:44,083
‎兩方人馬在同一晚

1251
01:49:44,166 --> 01:49:48,750
‎鎖定同一名學員的機率多大？

1252
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:49,708
‎不大

1253
01:49:50,791 --> 01:49:52,041
‎微乎其微

1254
01:49:53,916 --> 01:49:58,958
‎除非一方偶然遇到了另一方

1255
01:49:59,041 --> 01:50:02,041
‎也許一方，也就是說亞提莫斯和麗雅

1256
01:50:02,125 --> 01:50:05,875
‎只想找一具屍體

1257
01:50:05,958 --> 01:50:08,125
‎而機會突然出現了

1258
01:50:08,208 --> 01:50:11,958
‎他們不在乎屍體的身分
‎只要有心臟就好

1259
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:15,208
‎但他們絕對不敢殺人

1260
01:50:15,291 --> 01:50:19,416
‎不，是另一方有意殺人

1261
01:50:21,458 --> 01:50:23,708
‎而且是刻意要殺此人

1262
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:25,333
‎為何？

1263
01:50:32,625 --> 01:50:35,166
‎蘭道，會不會是為了報復？

1264
01:50:50,583 --> 01:50:53,416
‎派希？

1265
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:07,583
‎-救命
‎-你的同夥是誰？

1266
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:35,291
‎有人在嗎？

1267
01:51:41,541 --> 01:51:42,375
‎有人嗎？

1268
01:52:08,916 --> 01:52:13,166
‎於是，凶手被打斷了

1269
01:52:14,916 --> 01:52:17,541
‎但他的目的已達成

1270
01:52:19,458 --> 01:52:22,125
‎並悄悄返回他在巴特莫鎮的農舍

1271
01:52:23,708 --> 01:52:25,291
‎沒有被任何人發現

1272
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:31,291
‎但他萬萬沒想到自己隔天被召回西點

1273
01:52:32,583 --> 01:52:35,333
‎而且得知死者的屍體

1274
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:38,916
‎竟遭人嚴重肢解

1275
01:52:39,625 --> 01:52:43,541
‎這完美掩飾了他的罪行

1276
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,833
‎彷彿受到了上帝的保佑

1277
01:52:50,291 --> 01:52:54,833
‎被指派調查他自己犯下的命案

1278
01:52:57,208 --> 01:53:03,666
‎到頭來，亞提莫斯和麗雅
‎將永遠被視為殺人犯

1279
01:53:04,583 --> 01:53:06,416
‎沒有所謂的永遠

1280
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:10,916
‎他們會遭遺忘，正如我們所有人一樣

1281
01:53:11,541 --> 01:53:14,041
‎我不會遺忘他們

1282
01:53:16,166 --> 01:53:17,875
‎尤其是我的麗雅

1283
01:53:20,541 --> 01:53:23,625
‎她原本能成為人妻，蘭道
‎成為一個母親

1284
01:53:27,875 --> 01:53:31,166
‎我也不會忘記
‎你是如何把我們當傻瓜玩弄

1285
01:53:32,791 --> 01:53:33,791
‎傻瓜

1286
01:53:37,583 --> 01:53:39,291
‎而我是最傻的一個

1287
01:53:41,291 --> 01:53:43,291
‎-不是嗎？
‎-不

1288
01:53:49,458 --> 01:53:53,333
‎我一直都打算向你自首

1289
01:53:53,416 --> 01:53:57,625
‎我從第一次見到你的那一刻就知道了
‎結果不出所料

1290
01:54:03,875 --> 01:54:04,791
‎我…

1291
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:11,166
‎若你想要我道歉，就如你所願

1292
01:54:13,083 --> 01:54:14,583
‎我不想要你的道歉

1293
01:54:16,541 --> 01:54:19,291
‎不，我想要答案

1294
01:54:21,416 --> 01:54:24,291
‎你怎麼知道是弗萊強暴小瑪？

1295
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:35,416
‎那些牛羊也是你殺的嗎？

1296
01:54:36,708 --> 01:54:39,041
‎-當然是
‎-那貝林傑呢？

1297
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:44,958
‎貝林傑

1298
01:54:45,875 --> 01:54:47,333
‎我不得不挖出他的心

1299
01:54:48,541 --> 01:54:50,875
‎才能看起來像是撒旦崇拜者所為

1300
01:54:50,958 --> 01:54:53,333
‎對我這老頭子來說
‎可不是容易的差事

1301
01:54:55,125 --> 01:54:57,791
‎你怎麼知道貝林傑也有涉案？

1302
01:55:01,041 --> 01:55:02,041
‎弗萊的日記

1303
01:55:05,166 --> 01:55:07,083
‎貝林傑也認罪了嗎？

1304
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:10,500
‎-有的，我逼他招供
‎-住手，拜託

1305
01:55:12,083 --> 01:55:14,333
‎還有誰跟你們一起？

1306
01:55:14,416 --> 01:55:15,625
‎朱利斯斯達德

1307
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:18,833
‎朱利斯

1308
01:55:21,041 --> 01:55:21,958
‎對不起

1309
01:55:24,333 --> 01:55:25,333
‎他們都…

1310
01:55:28,458 --> 01:55:30,250
‎他們都記得她的名字

1311
01:55:31,541 --> 01:55:35,958
‎我也確保他記得她當時穿的衣服

1312
01:55:36,791 --> 01:55:39,250
‎一個細節也不放過

1313
01:55:39,958 --> 01:55:43,458
‎只不過斯達德似乎逃過了你的私刑

1314
01:55:44,083 --> 01:55:50,541
‎我沒有力氣或意志追殺他

1315
01:55:50,625 --> 01:55:51,750
‎我只希望…

1316
01:55:54,833 --> 01:56:00,583
‎他下半輩子都會活在恐懼之中

1317
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:08,333
‎他們的惡行令人髮指

1318
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:13,333
‎但你大可以去找塞耶，逼他們認罪

1319
01:56:13,416 --> 01:56:15,125
‎我不要他們認罪

1320
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:21,250
‎我要他們死

1321
01:56:31,916 --> 01:56:33,041
‎那現在呢？

1322
01:56:35,791 --> 01:56:36,666
‎現在？

1323
01:56:38,333 --> 01:56:39,583
‎一切由你決定

1324
01:56:49,666 --> 01:56:51,750
‎我有兩張字條

1325
01:56:54,041 --> 01:56:55,958
‎能送你上絞架

1326
01:57:19,041 --> 01:57:20,083
‎好吧

1327
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:21,625
‎埃德加，我時常但願

1328
01:58:22,916 --> 01:58:25,916
‎我的小瑪能在舞會那天

1329
01:58:27,583 --> 01:58:31,250
‎遇見你

1330
01:58:34,041 --> 01:58:35,041
‎誰知道呢？

1331
01:58:42,708 --> 01:58:44,583
‎我們可能真會成為一家人

1332
01:58:52,333 --> 01:58:53,750
‎我很珍惜…

1333
01:59:01,541 --> 01:59:05,250
‎我們的…

1334
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,166
‎蘭道，再見了

1335
02:00:36,333 --> 02:00:37,958
‎吾愛，安息吧

1336
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:54,583
