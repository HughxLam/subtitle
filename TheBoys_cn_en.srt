00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,444
沃特工作室

2
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:15,070
看不见的无法杀死

3
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:17,281
《透明人：隐形力量2》 即将来袭

4
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:20,159
《隐形力量2》让我太激动了
Yo, I am so psyched for Invisible Force 2.

5
00:00:20,242 --> 00:00:24,204
拜托 《隐形力量1》很差劲 我喜欢《涨潮》
Please. Invisible Force 1 was lame.

6
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:25,497
《涨潮》？
I'm all about Rising Tide. Rising Tide? The Deep?

7
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:28,792
深海？透明人可以打败深海
-Uh-huh. Translucent could kick the Deep's ass.

8
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:30,210
怎么打败他？透明人可以隐形
How? He's invisible.

9
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:31,670
他就只有一个本领 就只有这个
That's, like, all he's got. That's it.

10
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:34,256
正是如此 他悄悄地靠近深海
Exactly. He sneaks up on the Deep,

11
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,592
然后 砰 龟孙子！坐下！
and then boom, motherfucker!

12
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:39,595
直到深海让一条鲨鱼 咬掉透明人的小鸡鸡
-Sit down. Until the Deep makes a shark bite Translucent's dick off.

13
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:41,680
他怎能找到透明人的小鸡鸡？ 它也是透明的
How's he gonna find his dick? It's invisible.

14
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:51,440
不好了
Holy shit.

15
00:00:58,864 --> 00:00:59,698
本吉
Benjy!

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,083
起来 快啊 本吉 快！
Get up. Get up, get up, get up. Come on, Benjy. Come on, come on.

17
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,784
别过来 他妈的不要过来
Stay back. Just stay the fuck back.

18
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:46,787
你在笑什么？
What are you smiling at?

19
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:07,641
祖国人？
BENJY: Homelander?

20
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,019
你们没事吧？
You boys okay?

21
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,483
我们可以…合影吗？
Can I. . . can I get a selfie?

22
00:02:18,026 --> 00:02:19,361
当然可以
Course you can.

23
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:24,992
超级七人队的梅芙女王跟祖国人 今天再度英勇救人
ANCHOR: The Seven's Queen Maeve and Homelander

00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:27,995
在布鲁克林的街道上 拦截了一辆被挟持的装甲卡车
made another heroic save today, stopping a hijacked armored truck

25
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:30,706
还留下来 跟一些非常幸运的粉丝合影
on the streets of Brooklyn, then staying behind for a photo op

26
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:32,875
-吉恩？ 谢谢 珍妮弗 现在…
-with some very lucky fans. Nice to meet you. Jean? Thanks, Jennifer. And now. . .

27
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:37,713
这算是全功能一体的蓝牙扬声器
HUGHIE: So, this is pretty much everything in one. Bluetooth speakers.

28
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,715
是立体声的 可以装在客厅的任何地方
It's in stereo, so you can put it all around your living room, have some fun with it.

29
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:42,759
尽情享用它 你说你有个标准的线盒 对吗？
You said you have a standard cable box, right?

30
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:46,388
好的 那我需要给你弄一个音频转发器 Apt-X编码 低延迟
-Uh-huh. Okay, then I need to get you an audio transmitter,

31
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:49,975
能减少音频延迟 而且有标准的光纤输入
aptX Low Latency. It makes it so there's less audio lag, and it's got a standard optical in.

32
00:02:50,058 --> 00:02:53,562
就给你选一千兆的高清多媒体界面接口吧 就用这个吧
And let's hook you up with thousand-meg HDMI.

33
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:56,982
这个稍贵一点 但是碳的传导性好很多
Let's go with this one. Uh, it costs a little bit more, but the carbon's way more conductive.

34
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:13,999
嘿 加里 我真的需要跟你谈件事
Hey, Gary. Um. . .

35
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:14,917
以后再谈 小子
-I really need to talk to you about something. Later, kid.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,251
好的
Okay. Cool.

37
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:17,961
以后再谈…你…
Later you want, like. . . want, like, 30-30 minutes?

38
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:21,214
是指30分钟？还是45分钟？
Like, a solid 45?

39
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:26,094
先生 打扰一下
Excuse me, sir?

40
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:31,266
你好 我想约个时间请你过来
Hi. I'd like to make an appointment

41
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:31,516
for you to come over and. . .

42
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,186
铺线
lay some cable.

43
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,147
好的 洛缤
Okay. Uh. . . oh, Robin.

44
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:39,399
亲爱的洛缤
Oh, dear, dear, Robin.

45
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,027
那个词的意思跟你想的不一样
Um, that doesn't mean what you think it means.

46
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:44,947
“铺线”是指做爱
Um, "laying cable" means sex.

47
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,199
不对 “铺水管”才指做爱
No, "laying pipe" means sex.

48
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:49,993
“铺线”的意思是你要我去你家
"Laying cable" means you want me to come over to your house

49
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:51,828
拉一大泡屎
-and just take a big, old shit.

50
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,163
真恶心
-That's disgusting. Well, okay.

51
00:03:53,246 --> 00:03:55,207
好吧 但是你…不过这是谁说的？
But you. . . Who-who said it, though?

52
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,792
好吧 你准备好了吗？
Okay. Are you ready? Despite your best efforts,

53
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:59,419
尽管你尽了最大努力 我其实还很饿
I'm actually still hungry.

54
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:01,588
其实我现在更饿了
-I'm actually more hungry now.

55
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:04,675
我们说了这些撩人的话以后
-Where are we gonna go after all this hot talk? I don't know.

56
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,259
-要去哪里呢？ 不知道

57
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:09,012
更重要的是 我们之后要去哪里铺线？
-You know? More importantly, where are we gonna go to lay some cable afterwards?

58
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:10,097
老天爷
Geez.

59
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,431
你问他了吗？
So, did you ask him?

60
00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:13,308
谁？
-Who? Gary.

61
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:17,562
加里 你向加里要求加薪了吗？
Did you ask Gary for the raise?

62
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:21,233
对的 今天…今天事特别多
Yeah. Yeah. It was it was a. . .

63
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:24,987
他超级忙 但是明天一定问 是的
Look, it was a crazy day, and-and he was super busy, but tomorrow for sure. Yes.

64
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:26,196
好吧
Okay.

65
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:30,867
我该怎么做？就像祖国人一样踢倒他的门？
What was I supposed to do, kick his door down?

66
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:31,368
Like Homelander?

67
00:04:31,994 --> 00:04:32,828
我说了“好吧”
I said "okay. "

68
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:34,579
是的 但你言不由衷
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

69
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:37,791
我看到了你的表情 我看见了 少来了
Hey, I see the look. I see it. Come on.

70
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:42,963
这就像我们刚开始谈恋爱时一样
This is like when we started dating.

71
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:46,008
我不认为这是真的
I don't think that's. . . I don't think that's true.

72
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,301
老兄 当时是我约你出来的
Dude, I had to ask you out.

73
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:51,722
抱歉我让你久等了 你听过“彬彬有礼”这个词吗？
Well, excuse me for waiting.

74
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:55,350
听好了 这是关于让你得到应得的东西
You ever hear of chivalry? Listen, this is about you getting what you deserve.

75
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:58,812
我在学校非常努力 因为我觉得 如果我们俩
I'm killing myself at school because I think it's gonna be worth it for both of us.

76
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:02,357
搬到一起住的话 这些努力会是值得的
You know, if we move in together.

77
00:05:03,608 --> 00:05:06,194
等等 什么？等等 嘿 你刚才说了什么？
Wait, what? What? W-W-Wait. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. What was that?

78
00:05:06,653 --> 00:05:07,988
你刚才说了什么？
What'd you just say?

79
00:05:08,822 --> 00:05:12,868
我是说我们不能 继续在你爸家铺水管
Well, I mean, we can't keep, you know, laying pipe

80
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:17,831
尽量不发出声音 盯着那张愚蠢的比利乔尔的海…
at your dad's place. Trying to be all quiet. Staring up at that dumb Billy Joel post. . .

81
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:24,504
海报
-. . . poster. Hey.

82
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:27,674
嘿 你绝不可以
Don't you ever besmirch Billy Jo. . .

83
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,301
诋毁比利乔尔

84
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:06,630
我停不下来
I can't stop. I can't stop. I can't stop. I can't stop.

85
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,464
Can't stop. Can't stop.

86
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:12,135
洛缤？
Robin?

87
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:18,225
洛缤？
Robin?

88
00:06:21,853 --> 00:06:22,813
洛缤！

89
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,941
洛缤！

00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:11,653
请转过来
CASTING DIRECTOR: Turn around, please.

98
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:20,537
好的 给我们看看 亲爱的
Okay. Let's see it, dear.

99
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:22,956
你应该把头转过去
-You should look away. Sorry?

100
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,124
你说什么？

101
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:26,626
你不要看摄像机 而且要闭上眼睛
You should turn away from the camera,

102
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,211
否则我会把你弄瞎的
and you should close your eyes, or else I'll blind you.

103
00:07:29,171 --> 00:07:30,005
好的
All right.

104
00:07:31,715 --> 00:07:32,966
好了 开始吧
Okay, go ahead.

105
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,352
非常抱歉 你还好吗？
I am so sorry. Are you all right?

106
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,316
我出生的时候就有超能力
I was born Super-Abled.

107
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:52,777
我妈妈高兴坏了
Uh, my mom was thrilled.

108
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:56,656
她带我去参加 所有小英雄小姐选美
She took me to all the little miss hero pageants,

109
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,033
但我很不喜欢
but I hated it.

110
00:07:58,617 --> 00:08:02,287
我还能闻到喷发定型剂的气味
Ugh, I mean, I can still. . . smell the hairspray.

111
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:05,457
但是
Uh, but. . .

112
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:10,837
在问答环节 他们总是问我我的愿望是什么
. . . at the Q and A, they always asked me what my wish was,

113
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:14,549
我总是说：“拯救世界”
and I always said, "to save the world. "

114
00:08:15,675 --> 00:08:20,513
评委总会咯咯笑 好像觉得我的答案很可爱
And the judges just chuckled

115
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:20,222
like it was cute.

116
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:24,351
但那对我来说并不是个玩笑
But it wasn't a joke to me.

117
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:32,234
从什么时候开始 怀抱希望与天真无邪 变成了一码事了？
Since when did "hopeful" and "naive"

118
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:32,609
become the same thing?

119
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:37,572
如果不是为了拯救世界 你为什么会进入这一行？
I mean, why would you get into this business

120
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:38,365
if not to save the world?

121
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,785
这就是我一直想要的
That's all I have ever wanted.

122
00:08:44,704 --> 00:08:49,251
因此 我一直希望能进入超级七人队
And that's why I've always wanted

123
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:51,002
to be in The Seven.

124
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,182
谢谢 珍妮弗
ANCHOR: Thanks, Jennifer.

125
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:06,184
我觉得洛缤的葬礼很不错
Thought Robin's service was nice.

126
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:10,105
你看到有多少人来了吗？
Did you see how many people came? Wow.

127
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:17,529
大家很尊重她 现场充满了爱意
Lot of respect for that girl. Lot of love in the room.

128
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:20,323
还有那些餐点 真丰盛
And the spread. What a spread.

129
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:22,284
真的很不错
Just really nice.

130
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,953
但那都不能传达…
MADELYN: That does not begin to convey

131
00:09:25,036 --> 00:09:26,288
新闻 火车头献上最深切的哀悼
the terrible regret. . .

132
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:28,081
-…沉痛的慰问… 也许在播放电影之类的…
Aw, geez. Maybe there's a movie on.

133
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:28,999
不 别换台
-No, keep it. No, we can switch it.

134
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,208
-不 我们可以换台 就看这个
-Keep it. . . . awful, tragic loss.

135
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:37,299
我向洛缤沃德的家人送上最深切的哀悼
My deepest condolences to Robin Ward's family.

136
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:41,344
我当时正在追捕银行劫犯
I was chasing these bank robbers.

137
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:45,432
她刚好走到了马路中间 而我当时不能…
She just stepped in the middle of the street, and I-I couldn't. . .

138
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:49,519
“中间”…她当时离该死的路牙 还有半步距离
Middle of the. . . She was a half step off the fucking curb.

139
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:52,689
冷静 别这样 休伊 别生气 好吗？
Oh, now, come on, Hughie. Just, uh, don't get upset, okay? Just. . .

140
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:54,399
就…他心知肚明
He knows. MADELYN: . . . swift, thoughtful attention. . .

141
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:01,614
Now I think that A-Train would like to get back to work.

142
00:10:01,656 --> 00:10:06,494
在沃特的每个人 都为洛缤感到很难过
MAN: Everyone at Vought is just. . . just wrecked about Robin.

143
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:10,582
你们俩并没有结婚
Now, you two weren't married, and look,

144
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,752
严格来说 并没有合法索赔
technically, there's no legal claim.

145
00:10:14,044 --> 00:10:16,671
但沃特想做该做的事
But. . . Vought wants to do the right thing:

146
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,550
赔偿你4万5千美元
offer you $45, 000 in restitution.

147
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:27,223
你只需要在这里签名 我就可以给你支票
All you have to do is sign right here,

148
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:27,265
and I'll offer you the check.

149
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:32,187
这是一个保密协议
This is a confidentiality agreement.

150
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,105
就是个常见的保密协议
It's a boilerplate NDA.

151
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:38,902
签了这个我就不能再谈这件事？
I sign this, and. . .

152
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,944
I can't talk about it?

153
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:42,072
我要假装这事没有发生过？
Have to pretend like it didn't happen,

154
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:45,075
就好像我当时手里没有抓着洛缤的手臂？
like I wasn't holding Robin's arms in my hands?

155
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:48,703
我知道你很难过 但我们只是想帮你
Look, I know you're upset, but we're just trying to help.

156
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,331
那就说“对不起”
Then say you're sorry.

157
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:53,166
你说什么？
Excuse me?

158
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:57,879
你们的人说：“我们的哀悼” “我们的慰问”以及“我们很遗憾”
I mean, you people say "our condolences"

159
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:57,754
and "my sympathies" and "our regrets, "

160
00:10:57,962 --> 00:11:02,050
但没有一个人看着我的眼睛说 “对不起！”
but nobody can look me in the fucking eye and say "I'm sorry. "

161
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:05,220
我什么都不签 出去
I'm not signing anything. Get out.

162
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,474
我说了 滚出去！
I said get the hell out!

163
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:16,481
你还好吗？
You okay?

164
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:24,239
正如我所说 这是个常见的保密协议 真的挺普通的
As I said, boilerplate NDA, really.

165
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,739
Pretty standard stuff.

166
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:26,491
我可以考虑一下吗？
Can I think about it?

167
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:33,540
如果你有任何疑问 就…
If you have any questions at all, just, uh. . .

168
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:47,637
44号警员 交通事故 地址是第63号大街1420号…
DISPATCHER: Unit 44, code 20. Address is 1420 63rd Street. . .

169
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:50,723
外面有疯子在闹事吗？
Any maniacs out there?

170
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:52,600
安静的夜晚
Mm-mm. Quiet night. Like every night.

171
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:54,310
每个夜晚都一样
That's too bad.

172
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:58,231
太糟了 我们现在真的需要媒体曝光率
We could really use the press right now.

173
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:02,110
安妮
Oh, Annie.

174
00:12:02,193 --> 00:12:03,361
我饿了
I'm hungry.

175
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,114
别担心 我没有得到那份工作
Don't worry. I didn't get the job.

176
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:07,449
这可难说
You don't know that.

177
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:10,952
他们在全国找女孩面试
They're auditioning girls nationwide.

178
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:14,956
再说 可能是伯爵夫人得到了那份工作 她在演播室的表现很好
Besides, Countess probably got it. She's so good in a room.

179
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:17,584
如果你态度消极 就会遇到不好的事
If you're negative, negative things happen to you.

180
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:22,255
喂？是的 我是她妈妈
Hello? Yes, I'm her mother.

181
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:27,218
好的 等一下
Uh, yes. Uh. . . uh, one moment.

182
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,513
是他们打来的
: It's them. It's them.

183
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:35,059
喂？是的 我就是
Hello? Yes, this is she.

184
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:40,190
我被选上了？
I got it?

185
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:42,358
你被选上了！
-You got it! You got it!

186
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,319
Shh.

187
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,946
我的天啊
: Oh, my God.

188
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,533
真抱歉 刚才信号不好
Uh, I'm so. . . I'm so sorry. It's a weird connection.

189
00:12:50,617 --> 00:12:52,452
我其实不知道刚才是怎么回事
I don't know what that was, actually. Uh. . . Mm-hmm.

190
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:57,499
她身上没有身份证 但是有件事
HUGHIE: Oh, shit.

191
00:12:57,582 --> 00:12:58,416
是吗？
MAN: Yeah?

192
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,876
我认为她是个瘾君子
MAN 2: I think she was an addict.

193
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,211
针孔？
MAN: Needle tracks?

194
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:02,587
在一只手臂上坑坑洼洼的
MAN 2: 12 marks on one arm.

195
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:05,131
更多的毒品正在进来
MAN: More dope coming in.

196
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:07,926
更多的毒贩工作
More pushers at work.

197
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:09,469
-你在干什么？ 人渣
What you doing?

198
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,638
不能以刑事案件起诉火车头
Can't file a criminal case

199
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:14,724
超人类就像警察一样 他们执行任务时造成伤亡的话不受指控
against A-Train. Supes are like cops. They can't be charged

200
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:15,642
好吧
-for damages while they're on the job. Okay.

201
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:17,477
但也许我们可以以“疏忽致死”的罪名起诉他
But maybe we can file a wrongful death.

202
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,480
我得让洛缤的父母同意这事
I just got to get Robin's parents to sign off on it.

203
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:22,774
休伊 过来跟我坐坐
-Hughie, come sit with me. Dad, I'm not. . .

204
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:24,317
爸爸 我正在…
-I'm right. . .

205
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:26,986
好吧
Okay.

206
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:35,662
你真好样的
Good for you.

207
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:38,998
你要为洛缤伸张正义
You want to make this right, what happened to Robin.

208
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,169
但你不能
But you can't.

209
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,422
所以签了这个吧
So sign this.

210
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,133
什么？
What?

211
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:53,638
这是很大一笔钱 休伊 我们真的能用得上这笔钱
This is a lot of money, Hughie.

212
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:53,680
We could really use it.

213
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:58,059
我不能…爸爸 他们杀死了她
I can't Dad, they killed her.

214
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:02,480
现实一点 好吗？就算我们付得起律师费 我们很可能付不起
Be realistic, okay? Even if we could pay for a lawyer--

215
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:04,232
案件也不成立
and that's a big if there's no case.

216
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:06,276
她当时在街道上 就当她是被公共汽车撞了
She was in the street. Be like if a bus hit her. Dad, she was one step

217
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:10,280
爸爸 她当时离路牙有一步之遥！ 我亲眼所见！
-off the curb. I. . .

218
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,446
-I saw it! Hughie, look. Look.

219
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:12,574
这事你做不成的
-You can't do this. Why not?

220
00:14:13,074 --> 00:14:16,202
-为什么不能？爸爸 我有… 你没有斗志 你从来就没有
-Dad, I have. . . You don't have the fight.

221
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,161
You never have.

222
00:14:21,124 --> 00:14:22,625
对不起 但这是真的
I'm sorry, but it's-it's true.

223
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:26,254
我也没有
Neither do I.

224
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:33,094
好了 过来跟我坐一坐 好吗？
Now. . . come and. . . come and sit with me, okay?

225
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:35,513
在播《雷明顿斯蒂尔》呢
Remington Steele's on.

226
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:38,558
休伊？你要去哪里？
-Hughie! Where you going?

227
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:50,320
…在沃特总部外面 在这里开年度股东…
TV REPORTER: . . . the red carpet outside of Vought headquarters, here for the annual shareholders presentation. . .

228
00:14:53,364 --> 00:14:55,825
她到了 欢迎来到纽约
ASHLEY: There she is. Welcome to New York.

229
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:58,703
我是艾诗丽巴瑞特 人才及关系部主管
I'm Ashley Barrett, director of talent relations.

230
00:14:58,786 --> 00:15:01,414
那这些人全都是为了我来这里的吗？
So, uh, are all these people here for me?

231
00:15:01,497 --> 00:15:05,209
亲爱的 他们还能是为了谁来这里的？
Oh, honey. Who else would they be here for?

232
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:07,295
来吧 我们迟到了
Come on. We're running late.

233
00:15:07,378 --> 00:15:08,755
天啊
Oh, my God.

234
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,552
星光！

235
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:19,057
女士们、先生们 毫无疑问
MADELYN: Ladies and gentlemen,

236
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:22,685
现在是加入超级英雄行业的好时机
it is without a doubt a good time to be in the Superhero business.

237
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:26,898
我们的净收入提高了14%
Our net income is up 14%.

238
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:30,360
我们最新的一部电影《G人：世界大战》
Our latest film, G-Men: World War,

239
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:35,531
在全球收入票房几乎有17亿美元
just grossed shy of $1. 7 billion world-wide.

240
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:39,786
今年秋天 我们在巴黎外的最新主题公园动土
And this fall, we break ground on our newest theme park outside of Paris.

241
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:43,206
品牌机会无穷无尽
The branding opportunities are limitless.

242
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:47,919
但大家知道 这一切都不是真正重要的
But, you know, none of that really matters.

243
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:53,925
因为最重要的工作是管理、支持
Because job one is managing, supporting,

244
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:56,969
及建议勇敢的英雄们
and advising the brave heroes

245
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,764
他们每天为了我们
who put themselves in harm's way each and every day

246
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:03,184
阻止伤害发生
for us.

247
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:05,978
我们来看一看
Let's take a look.

248
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:10,108
沃特国际2019年度股东大会

249
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:16,781
没有犯罪的世界 所有人享受自由与正义

00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:19,158
多亏了沃特家族的
that's within our reach,

252
00:16:19,242 --> 00:16:24,205
两百多名超级英雄 这个理想离我们并不远
thanks to the 200-plus Superheroes

253
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:28,126

255
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,506
对了 你迄今表现非常好
You're doing really well, by the way, so far.

256
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:36,134
我什么都没有做
I-I haven't done anything yet.

257
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:38,177
正是如此 你在18至49岁的 中西部及保守天主教徒中的
Yeah, exactly. You're already up

258
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:41,222
支持率已经领先了百分之二点五
two-and-a-half points with Midwesterners and conservative Christians in 18 to 49.

259
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:43,641
顺便提一下 你面试的那段讲话
That speech, by the way, your audition--

260
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:49,063
很谦逊、谦虚 非常聪明的选择
It was modest; it was humble. Really fucking smart choice.

261
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:51,232
我当时是认真的
Uh, I-I meant it.

262
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:53,109
是的 所以我们才爱你
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's why we love you.

263
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:56,446
你准备好了改变自己的生活吗？
So you ready for your life to change?

有两个世界观4号卫星

We can essentially read a getaway car's license plate from 380 miles up.

That is just. . .

00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,069
我是说…
I mean. . .

天啊 我以前用的 是从易趣网上买来的一个警讯监控仪
G I was working with a police scanner

307
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:28,908
是的 你现在不再用那个了
that I bought on eBay. Yeah, well, not anymore you're not.

308
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:32,787
等你看到了餐厅再说吧
Oh, and wait till you check out the dining room.

309
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,916
我们也许从格莱莫西酒馆偷了米罗 也许没有
We, uh, may or may not have stolen Miro

312
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:42,296
那是他的 对吗？
That's his, isn't it?

313
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:44,840
祖国人的？是的
Homelander's? Yeah.

314
00:20:46,175 --> 00:20:47,760
但你很快就会有自己的座位了
But you'll have your own soon.

315
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:50,680
来 过来 试一下
Here. Come on. Give it a test drive.

316
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:52,723
来吧
Come on.

317
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:55,643
你还好吧？
O-Oh, you-you okay?

318
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:57,853
只是…
It's just. . .

319
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,735
我以前常站在镜子前面
I used to stand in the mirror,

320
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:08,364
假装自己在我现在身处的地方
pretending to be where I am right now.

321
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:12,535
你知道吗？我第一天工作的时候
You know something? On my first day, I, uh. . .

322
00:21:13,494 --> 00:21:16,789
感觉…自己像是个骗子
Well, I-I felt like a fraud.

323
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:22,670
是的 好消息是大家都有同感
Yeah. But the good news is, everybody feels that way.

324
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:26,424
谢谢
Thank you.

325
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:33,806
但是我们现在是一队的 我们会相互帮助
And, hey, we're a team now. We'll help each other out.

326
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:38,686
我打赌你从小就在墙上 贴了一张祖国人的海报
I bet growing up you had a poster of Homelander on your wall, huh?

327
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:41,731
不 其实 我…
No, actually, I. . .

328
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:45,484
我也说不清 祖国人是那么…
I don't know, Homelander's so--

329
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:47,987
他就像是耶稣之类的
He's like Jesus or something.

330
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:51,824
如果你想听实话
If you want to know the truth,

331
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,785
我其实贴了一张你的海报
I actually had a poster of you.

332
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:56,954
什么？真的？
Really?

333
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:59,123
是的 我有点…
-Yeah. Yeah. I kind of Oh.

334
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:02,793
我对你有种女学生的迷恋
I kind of had a schoolgirl crush on you.

335
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:04,837
-我的… 我的天啊
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

336
00:22:05,463 --> 00:22:07,715
我希望说出来不会太唐突
I hope that's not inappropriate to say.

337
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:09,550
不 一点都不会唐突
No, no, no, no, no. It's not inappropriate at all.

338
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:12,094
就是有点疯狂
-It's just, it's kind of wild.

339
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:21,020
怎么了？
What?

340
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:25,107
你刚才说了迷恋我 我想着 你知道…
I mean, you said you had a crush on me. I figured that, you know. . .

341
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:28,277
嘿 听着 你很美
-That is. . . Whoa, whoa, wh-wh-whoa, hey. Look, you're gorgeous.

342
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,237
我不是指做爱
I'm not I'm not talking about sex,

343
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:32,156
就是来点口交
just a little bit of pole-smoking.

344
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,116
嘿 等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

345
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,620
这只关乎你到底有多渴望进入超级七人队
It's just a question of how bad you want to be in The Seven.

346
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:47,505
你说什么？
-Excuse me? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

347
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:52,301
别激动
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Take it easy.

348
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:56,055
冷静 我们只是在聊天而已
Settle down. We're just, we're just talking.

349
00:22:57,389 --> 00:23:00,059
听着 我知道你很强大 我明白
And look, I know that you're powerful.

350
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:02,228
你的超能力可不是盖的
I get it. Your powers are no joke.

351
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:06,816
问题是 我是这里的二把手
The thing is. . . I am number two around here.

352
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:11,070
所以要是我发话 你就会被赶出这里
So, like, if I say so, you know, you'd be out of here.

353
00:23:12,363 --> 00:23:14,073
尤其是在你袭击我之后
Especially since you attacked me.

354
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:15,783
我什么？
I what?

355
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:17,409
是的 你看
Yeah. Look.

356
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:22,706
爱荷华州的甜心 得梅因的守护者
I mean, Iowa's sweetheart, the Defender of Des Moines,

357
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,959
精神错乱 疯狂袭击了深海
just went psycho on the Deep.

358
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:29,839
我是说 那能让你从这一行消失的
I mean, that. . . that could put you out of the business.

359
00:23:30,464 --> 00:23:31,298
是的
Yeah.

360
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:35,344
尾巴夹在两腿之间 回家去找妈妈
I mean, home to Mommy, tail tucked between your legs.

361
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,931
想想所有那些孩子们 我是指那些孩子们
Just think of all those kids. I mean, the kids.

362
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:43,936
所有那些崇拜你的孩子 他们会悲痛欲绝的
Those kids who look up to you, they'd just be shattered.

363
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:49,150
那并不是你真正想要的 对吗？
I mean, th-that's not what you really want, right?

364
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:52,903
或者我们可以组成团队
Or we come together as a team.

365
00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:56,866
你和我一起随机应变
You and me, we just roll with the punches,

366
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,077
也许只需要三分钟
for, like, three minutes, maybe.

367
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,412
这没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal.

368
00:24:02,913 --> 00:24:04,331
然后 你知道会发生什么吗？
And then you know what happens?

369
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,209
你所有的梦想都会实现
All your dreams come true.

370
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,383
我肯定你们全都听说了
I-I'm sure you guys have all heard

371
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:18,137
透明人昨天晚上在扬克斯 阻止了一起入室行窃案
that Translucent stopped a home invasion

372
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,974
一个年轻的单亲妈妈和她的两个小孩 真是不可思议 真的…
in Yonkers last night, a young, single mother and her two kids.

373
00:24:20,347 --> 00:24:22,808
Just incredible. Just. . .

374
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:25,769
告诉我们 你怎么能够消失？
So tell us, how are you able to-to vanish?

375
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:27,354
不 我并不是真正消失
No, I don't actually vanish.

376
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:31,525
我的皮肤变成一种碳素超颖材料
My skin turns into this carbon meta-material

377
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,526
可以像隐身斗篷一样
that bends the light.

378
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,236
让光线弯曲
Like an invisibility cloak.

379
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,365
好的 我们要问清楚 你必须全裸 对吗？
All right, but just to be clear, you have to be completely naked, right?

380
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:43,162
很感激你来上节目 老兄 我很爱你们

at Invisible Force 2, and later, Translucent himself. . .

383
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:51,420
你对保姆监控摄像头感兴趣？
You interested in a nanny cam?

384
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:53,631
因为我们正好在搞特价
'Cause we're actually running a special on that.

385
00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:56,008
这只熊挺受欢迎的 眼睛里有摄像头
Um, it's a pretty popular bear. There's cameras in the eyes.

386
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:59,511
告诉我 有多少保姆会摇晃宝宝？
BUTCHER: Tell me, how many nannies shake their babies?

387
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,514
你说什么？
Uh, I'm sorry?

388
00:25:03,057 --> 00:25:06,101
就是猛烈地摇晃 就像…
You know, a good. . . hard shake, like. . .

389
00:25:06,977 --> 00:25:09,855
想把番茄酱从瓶子里挤出来一样
like tryin' to get ketchup out of a bottle.

390
00:25:10,773 --> 00:25:12,483
1%？更少？
One percent? Less?

391
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:14,443
我并不知道
I-I don't really know.

392
00:25:14,985 --> 00:25:15,819
真好笑
Funny, that.

393
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,073
他们这种破产品 在全世界有10亿美元的销售额
They sell a billion dollars worth of that shit worldwide.

394
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,660
挺能说明问题的 不是吗？
Goes to show you, doesn't it?

395
00:25:22,743 --> 00:25:24,703
如果你能把人吓唬住
The bollocks people will believe

396
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:26,956
他们愿意相信一些胡说八道
if you get them scared enough. Cool.

397
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:29,833
好
Cool, cool.

398
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,961
很好
Um. . .

399
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:35,965
今天有什么需要我帮忙的吗 还是…
Is there anything I can help you with today, or. . . ?

400
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:37,967
我不给你添乱了 休伊
I'm not gonna piss you about, Hughie.

401
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:40,886
我听说洛缤的事了
I heard what happened to Robin.

402
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,137
不好意思 你是谁？
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, who are you?

403
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:44,765
她当时并不是在街道上 她离那个路牙有一步之遥
She wasn't in the street. She was one step off the fucking curb.

404
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:47,476
而你没有接受赔偿
And you didn't take the pay-off.

405
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,478
是的 我问你呢 你到底是谁？ 你怎么知道这些的？
Yeah. I said, who the hell are you?

406
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,021
我叫布彻尔
How do you know that? Name's Butcher.

407
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:52,481
比利布彻尔
Billy Butcher.

408
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:53,399
联调局

409
00:25:55,442 --> 00:26:00,072
听着 我想着你和我应该聊一聊
Listen, I was thinking that, uh, you and me should have a little bit of a chat.

410
00:26:03,325 --> 00:26:04,952
你是联邦调查员？
Y-You're a Fed? You don't sound like a Fed.

411
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:07,663
-你听起来不像联邦调查员 怎么了？我不能是移民？
What, I can't immigrate?

412
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:09,498
海港那里有座巨大的绿色雕像
There's a giant green slapper with her ass in the harbor

413
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:10,624
它所象征的可不是这样
that says different.

414
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,001
你看起来也不像
You don't really look like one, either.

415
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:14,003
不像？那我看起来像什么？
No? What do I look like?

416
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:17,131
像是你是色情版《黑客帝国》的主演
Like you're starring in a porn version of The Matrix.

417
00:26:17,214 --> 00:26:19,174
上面白纸黑字写着呢
Well, it's all right there in black and white.

418
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:21,635
好吧 我到底能为你做什么？
Okay. Uh, what exactly can I do for you?

419
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:23,929
不 你完全理解错了 休伊
No, you got it all wrong, Hughie.

420
00:26:24,013 --> 00:26:25,806
应该是我能为你做什么
It's what I can do for you.

421
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:27,599
明白吗 你并不是一个人 小子
You see, you ain't alone, son.

422
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:29,518
这种事比你以为的要多很多
It happens a lot more than you think.

423
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:33,022
超人类每年间接害死几百人
Supes lose hundreds of people each year to collateral damage.

424
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:37,026
不 少来了 那样的话新闻早就大肆报道了 大家会尖叫着说那是该死的谋杀
No. Come on, that'd be all over the news. People would be screaming bloody murder.

425
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,111
是的 时不时也许会有些不合时宜的报道
Yeah, look, there might be the odd mention

426
00:26:39,194 --> 00:26:40,112
例如关于洛缤的新闻
of it now and again, like with Robin,

427
00:26:40,195 --> 00:26:43,657
但是更多所发生的事被隐瞒了
but there's a fuck-sight more that happens that just gets swept right under the rug.

428
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:45,617
为什么？
Why?

429
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:49,663
这不是很明显吗？
Ain't it obvious?

430
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:51,665
大洋地 潜入深海
Movie tickets, merchandising,

431

电影票、文化衍生品、主题公园、电子游戏
theme parks, video games.

432
00:26:55,377 --> 00:26:57,921
价值几十亿的全球工业
A multi-billion dollar global industry supported

433
00:26:58,005 --> 00:27:00,507
受企业说客
by corporate lobbyists

434
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:02,718
及两党政客的支持
and politicians on both sides.

435
00:27:03,344 --> 00:27:06,847
但你不会听到这些报道的主要原因
But the main reason that you won't hear about it

436
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,308
是因为公众不想知道
is 'cause the public don't want to know about it.

437
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:13,228
人们喜欢超人类带给他们的那种舒适感
See, people love that cozy feeling that Supes give them.

438
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:17,149
有些美好的王八蛋会从天而降 拯救世界
Some golden cunt to swoop out of the sky and save the day

439
00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:19,401
好让他们不必亲自去做这件事
so you don't got to do it yourself.

440
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:23,405

Fuckin' diabolical.

But then. . . that's where I come in.

Spank the bastards when they get out of line.

446
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:40,464
你怎样惩罚超人类？
How do you spank a Supe?

00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:20,804
然后他们会带你过超级七人塔的安检
Then they'll take you into The Seven Tower,

539
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:22,889
-然后你要装一个窃听器 窃听器？
through security, mate, and then you're gonna plant a bug. A bug?

540
00:33:22,973 --> 00:33:25,016
窃听器 能让我们窃听他们
A bug. And we'll have a little listen.

541
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:27,978
了解他们到底在搞什么鬼
See what's really going on.

542
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:30,188
好 抱歉 我先问清楚
Okay, let me just. . . sorry, let me just get this straight.

543
00:33:30,272 --> 00:33:33,859
你要我一个人去超级七人塔
You want me to. . . you want me to go to Seven Tower by myself,

544
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:36,528
而且你要我装一个窃听器？
and-and you want me to plant a bug,

545
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:38,572
怎么？就好像 我是该死的詹姆斯邦德一样？
like I'm. . . what, like I'm fuckin' James Bond?

546
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:40,157
是的 正是如此 你听懂了
-Yeah, exactly. You got it. You're FBI.

547
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,158
你是联调局的

548
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,536
你是联调局的 那就弄个搜查令啊 你为什么需要我？
If you're FBI, then get a warrant. Why do you. . . why do you even need me? Hughie, Hughie,

549
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:46,413
休伊 听好了 伙计
look, mate, I got a warrant, all right?

550
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,290
我有搜查令 好吗？

551
00:33:48,373 --> 00:33:50,250
但那个地方受保护
But that place is firewalled, untappable,

552
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,544
没办法窃听 而且封锁严密 比尼姑的裤头还紧
and locked up tighter than a nun's knickers.

553
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:54,296
我一辈子都不可能亲自进去里面
I couldn't get myself in there in a million years.

554
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:55,922
但你 小子 你可以进去
But you, son, you could do it.

555
00:33:56,006 --> 00:33:57,799
-不 我不能 好吗？ 可以的
-No, no, I can't, okay? Yeah.

556
00:33:57,883 --> 00:34:00,510
我不能 不 你是没有看到火车头浑身…
I can't. No. You didn't see A-Train covered in. . .

557
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:02,387
然后怎么样？我进去那里
And-and I'm, what, I'm just supposed to go in there,

558
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:06,183
然后要跟他握手并微笑？
and I'm supposed to. . . I'm supposed to shake his hand?

559
00:34:04,514 --> 00:34:06,516
-And smile? Yeah.

560
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:09,144
我不…你知道我最爱的音乐家是谁吗？
I'm not. . . Do you know who my favorite musician is?

561
00:34:09,227 --> 00:34:10,687
-是谁？ 詹姆斯泰勒
-Who? James Taylor.

562
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:14,065
然后是西蒙和加芬克尔 再然后是比利乔尔
Number two, Simon & Garfunkel. Number three, Billy Joel.

563
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:17,778
他们没有一个能渗透到众人当中 好吗？
Any of those guys, they don't infiltrate.

564
00:34:17,861 --> 00:34:18,695
我不是一个潜入者
Okay? I'm not an infiltrator.

565
00:34:19,112 --> 00:34:22,115
休伊 拿出点勇气来 你刚才听到了那个混蛋笑你女朋友
Hughie, Hughie, fucking grow a pair. You heard that cunt laughing at your girl.

566
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,160
不 我不能
No. No. No. No, I can't. I can't do that.

567
00:34:25,243 --> 00:34:26,620
我做不来
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna fuck it up,

568
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:28,413
对不起 我肯定会把这事搞砸的

569
00:34:28,497 --> 00:34:30,040
装不了你的窃听器
and you're not gonna have your bug. . .

570
00:34:30,916 --> 00:34:32,125
而且我会没命的
: . . . and I'll be dead.

571
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:35,295
我跟你不一样
I'm not. . . I'm not like you.

572
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:42,761
送给梅森 触摸天空！ 祝好 祖国人
: This is amazing, Madelyn.

573
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:44,304
太棒了 玛德琳 谢谢你送我这个
Thank you for this. My kid is gonna lose his mind.

574
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:45,889
我的孩子肯定会高兴得疯掉的

575
00:34:46,515 --> 00:34:49,893
我们很荣幸 别在网上出售就好
Ah, it is our pleasure. Just do not sell it online.

576
00:34:51,895 --> 00:34:53,605
好了 你有什么想法？
All right. What are you thinking?

577
00:34:53,688 --> 00:34:56,191
巴尔的摩是个美丽的城市
Baltimore is a beautiful town.

578
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:58,151
但你们有个问题
But you've got a problem.

579
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,030
你们的谋杀案件增加了多少？62%？
Your homicide rates are up, what, 62%?

580
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,782
警察无法破案
The police are not closing cases.

581
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:05,700
你们都快需要联邦生命线资助了
You're on the verge of needing a federal lifeline.

582
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,078
有话直说 玛德琳
Cut to the chase, Madelyn.

583
00:35:08,161 --> 00:35:09,412
你有什么提议？
Who are you proposing?

584
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:13,959
努比亚王子 他适合你们的人口组成
Nubian Prince. Fits your population's demo,

585
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:16,127
但不会太好战
but not too militant.

586
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:20,298
白种人也喜欢他 赞成率59%
Caucasians love him, too, with a. . . 59% approval rate.

587
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:25,262
我愿意给你一份三年的独家合约
I am willing to give you a three-year exclusive contract

588
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:26,680
附送全面的公关支持
with full PR support,

589
00:35:26,763 --> 00:35:29,349
而且我给你衍生文化品销售的
and I'm gonna give you nine and a half points

590
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:31,142
百分之九点五
of the merchandising.

591
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:32,978
我以为他在底特律
I thought he was in Detroit.

592
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:35,188
我们正考虑采取行动
Well, we're thinking about making a move.

593
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:36,940
多少钱？
How much?

594
00:35:37,023 --> 00:35:38,984
一年3亿
-$300 million a year.

595
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:46,157
我知道 金额巨大
I know, I know, it's a tough swallow.

596
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:49,411
但我们俩都知道你的城市需要一个英雄
But we both know that your city needs a hero.

597
00:35:51,538 --> 00:35:54,791
2亿买努比亚王子 我可以说服民众
$200 million for Nubian Prince.

598
00:35:53,582 --> 00:35:55,959
-I can sell that. Mm.

599
00:35:56,585 --> 00:35:58,962
抱歉 史蒂夫 我不能接受
I'm sorry, Steve, I can't do it.

600
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:01,047
亚特兰大正排队等着呢
We've got Atlanta waiting in the wings.

601
00:36:01,882 --> 00:36:03,383
我想也许你可以
-I think maybe you can.

602
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:05,302
为什么？
And why is that?

603
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:10,640
我恰好知道“五号化合物”的事
I happen to know about Compound V.

604
00:36:14,644 --> 00:36:15,854
“五号化合物”是什么？
What is Compound V?

605
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:17,689
就是能真正
It's the type of rumor

606
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:20,275
败坏你那些英雄的声名的谣言
that could really tarnish those heroes of yours.

607
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:23,111
没有人想看到这种情况 人们需要英雄
Nobody wants that. People need heroes.

608
00:36:23,904 --> 00:36:26,406
我可以确保那只会是谣言
Now, I can make sure that that stays a rumor,

609
00:36:26,489 --> 00:36:27,657
因为我是你们的朋友
because I'm a friend.

610
00:36:28,658 --> 00:36:30,535
但友谊有利也有弊
But friendship does cut both ways.

611
00:36:32,078 --> 00:36:34,706
抱歉 史蒂夫 我不知道你在说些什么
I'm sorry, Steve, I don't know what you're talking about.

612
00:36:36,082 --> 00:36:37,834
价格就是3亿
$300 million is the price,

613
00:36:38,793 --> 00:36:40,503
否则我们就去亚特兰大
or we go to Atlanta.

614
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:43,381
星光 她就像我们一样！
DONNA: So, how amazing is it?

615
00:36:43,465 --> 00:36:46,134
那里面到底有多棒？祖国人是怎么样的人？
What's Homelander like?

616
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:50,472
他很忙 我还没见到他呢 但是…
Uh. . . he's busy. I haven't really met him yet, but. . .

617
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:55,352
妈妈 我必须告诉你发生了什么事
Mom, I got to tell you what happened.

618
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:56,394
我忘了
Oh, I forgot.

619
00:36:56,478 --> 00:36:58,480
我有一次跟帕蒂和翠诗打麻将
I was playing mah-jongg with Patty and Trish,

620
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:00,106
帕蒂一直不停地说
and Patty is going on and on about how her daughter

621
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,150
她女儿进了医学院
got into med school, and I'm thinking, so what?

622
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,777
我就心想：“那又怎么样？”

623
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,279
我女儿进了超级七人队
My daughter got into The Seven!

624
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:08,323
好了 你刚才想跟我说什么？
Anyway, so-so, what did you want to tell me?

625
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:12,577
一切都很好
Everything's great.

626
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:15,455
就像我们梦想的一样
Just how we dreamed. Um. . .

627
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:19,709
妈妈 你知道吗？我得挂了
Mom, actually, you know what? I have to go.

628
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:21,002
好的 拜 宝贝
All right. Bye, honey.

629
00:37:42,565 --> 00:37:44,109
Um. . .

630
00:37:44,985 --> 00:37:47,696
打扰了 不好意思 你还好吗？
excuse me. I'm sorry, a-are you okay?

631
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,241
刚才那通电话似乎让人难过
Just seemed like a. . . tough call.

632
00:37:52,742 --> 00:37:55,120
-抱歉 我不是故意烦你的 不会 没事
Sorry. I don't mean to bother you. No, no, it's okay.

633
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:58,248
我很好 只是…
Uh. . . I'm fine. I'm just. . .

634
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:00,583
我只是今天过得不太好
I'm just having a bad day.

635
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:02,669
我也是
: Yeah, me, too.

636
00:38:05,714 --> 00:38:07,173
是工作上的事 还是
Uh. . . is it, like, a-a work thing, or. . .

637
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:09,467
生活上的事？
a-a life thing?

638
00:38:11,344 --> 00:38:12,762
工作上的事
It's a work thing.

639
00:38:15,098 --> 00:38:15,932
你呢？
You? Uh. . . life thing.

640
00:38:17,892 --> 00:38:18,977
生活上的事

641
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:27,360
你知道一个人会对自己有某种认识
You know how you have this. . .

642
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,861
image of yourself?

643
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:31,364
比如说 我以前以为自己很坚强
Like, I thought I was strong.

644
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:32,866
你明白吗？
You know? Like, made of steel.

645
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:35,201
钢筋铁骨 是一个斗士
A fighter.

646
00:38:35,285 --> 00:38:39,080
然后我遇到了一个混蛋 遇到了一个
And. . . then I was faced with this horrible situation

647
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:40,498
很可怕的情况
with this asshole. . .

648
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:43,251
然后…
and. . .

649
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:47,547
我在脑海里听见我妈妈的声音在说
I just heard my mom's voice in my head,

650
00:38:49,132 --> 00:38:52,969
“保持微笑 表演必须继续”
"Keep smiling, the show must go on, "

651
00:38:53,595 --> 00:38:55,889
我并没有抗争
and. . . I didn't fight.

652
00:38:56,723 --> 00:38:58,808
现在我觉得很恶心
And now I just feel sick.

653
00:39:00,226 --> 00:39:02,020
部分原因是因为我做了那种事 但…
Partly because I did it, but. . .

654
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,981
主要是因为…
mostly because. . .

655
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:10,653
原来我并不是自己所想的那种人
. . . turns out I'm not who I thought I was.

656
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:20,955
很抱歉 我不是故意要把这些事告诉你
-Oh. Oh, I'm, um, sorry. Uh. . . I-I didn't mean to just dump all of that

657
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,625
-给你造成负担的 不 你说出来完全关系
-onto you. No, no, it's totally fine that you dumped. Um. . .

658
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:30,757
你喜欢你的工作吗？
Listen, d-do you like your job?

659
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:34,469
那是我唯一想要的东西
Oh. It's the only thing I've ever wanted.

660
00:39:34,552 --> 00:39:35,929
那它是份好工作
And it's a good job?

661
00:39:36,554 --> 00:39:39,182
你不是在向孩子贩毒吧？
Like, you're not selling kids smack?

662
00:39:39,265 --> 00:39:41,392
不是 那是份很好的工作
No, it's a great job.

663
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,728
我可以帮助许多人
I could help a lot of people.

664
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,606
是这样的 我…
Thing is, I, um. . .

665
00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:49,526
以前认识一个女孩
used to know this girl,

666
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:53,696
我们以前常去洛克菲勒中心滑冰
and we used to go skating at Rockefeller,

667
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:57,242
我会在旁边 死死地抓着扶手
and I'd be on the side with this death grip on the rails.

668
00:39:58,201 --> 00:40:00,787
她则会一头冲进溜冰场中间
She would just charge headfirst into the middle of the rink.

669
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:03,123
而且她并不是…
And she wasn't. . . good.

670

很厉害

671
00:40:04,624 --> 00:40:05,959
她经常…
Like, she fell--

672
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,794
摔倒
a lot--

673
00:40:09,254 --> 00:40:10,713
但她从来都不怕
but she was never scared.

674
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:17,679
她以前总是说
And she always used to say:

675
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:21,224
“你摔倒了并不意味着你必须原地不动”
"Just 'cause you fall on your ass doesn't mean you have to stay there. "

676
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:25,395
所以你只是摔倒了 你知道吗？
So you fell on your ass, you know?

677
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:27,856
那并不是真正的你
That's not who you are.

678
00:40:30,692 --> 00:40:31,860

So who are you?

I'm gonna take that son of a bitch's head

这些混蛋在我的电影上映三周前出了盗版
three weeks before release,

724
00:43:18,234 --> 00:43:20,862
走在第五大街上 随便就能看到摆卖
and you can't walk down 5th Avenue without bumping into a table of unlicensed Homelander shirts.

725

Listening to us haggling over nickels.

735

Now, what I do want to hear

739
00:43:57,148 --> 00:43:58,524
Huh?

740

谁赞成？
Who's up for that?

741
00:44:02,737 --> 00:44:04,238
玄色
Black Noir.

742
00:44:04,572 --> 00:44:05,907
我们先从你开始
Let's start with you, man.

743
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:13,831
你养了一只狗？
Do you have a dog?

744
00:44:13,915 --> 00:44:15,041
没有
No.

745
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:17,377
好了 把你的手机给我们
All right, give us your phone.

746
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,712
要骗过全部安检人员
There's fuck-all security to worry about.

747
00:44:19,796 --> 00:44:21,255
事实上 他们是一群笨蛋
In fact, they're a bunch of muppets.

748
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:24,092
是的 金属探测器检测不到这个 好吗？
And the metal detector won't pick this up.

749
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:27,011
他们可能会带你过安检
Right? And what they'll probably do is take you

750
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:28,554
然后上去会议室
through the security and then up into the boardroom.

751
00:44:28,638 --> 00:44:31,057
坐下来 客气一点 友善一点
Sit down. Be nice, congenial.

752
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,102
然后很礼貌地跟他们说你要去拉一大泡屎
Then, real polite-like, tell 'em you're gonna take a fake shit.

753
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:36,187
去厕所里 拿出窃听器
Go into the bog, take the bug out.

754
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:39,232
把塑料撕下来 露出有粘性那一边
Peel back the plastic bit to reveal the sticky side.

755
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:41,609
把塑料放进厕所里 把它冲掉
Put the plastic bit in the bog. Flush it.

756
00:44:42,026 --> 00:44:45,905
然后回去会议室 坐下来 满脸笑容
Then go back into the boardroom,

757
00:44:45,988 --> 00:44:48,157
把窃听器装到桌子下面
sit down big smiles plant the bug underneath the table.

758
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:50,118
轻而易举 不费力气
Easy peasy Japanesey.

759
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:52,328
就是这样 就这么简单
Bob's your uncle. That's that.

760
00:44:52,412 --> 00:44:54,956
就这么简单？并不简单
-That's that? That was that was a lot. Yeah.

761
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:56,207

Th I've Hold on, can you just can you repeat it again?

762
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,209
你可不可以慢一点再说一遍 因为我…
Just a little bit slower? Because I. . .

763
00:44:59,252 --> 00:45:00,628
-听着 该死的
Shh. Listen.

764
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:02,713
休伊 冷静一下 好吗？
-Fuck. Hughie, calm down, all right?

765
00:45:03,548 --> 00:45:05,883
这就像《黑客帝国》那一场戏
This is like that scene in The Matrix.

766
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:09,220
你可以吞下那颗该死的红色药丸 好吗？
Now, you could take the fucking red pill, right?

767
00:45:09,303 --> 00:45:11,764
下半辈子都在手淫中度过

对着你的印度茶、绿拿铁之类的哭鼻子
crying into your chai tea

green latte, what the fuck. Or. . . you could take the blue pill.

770
00:45:19,605 --> 00:45:21,649
或者那应该是红色药丸？ 反正就是吃另一颗药丸
Or is it the red pill? Anyway, take the other pill

771
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:23,860
